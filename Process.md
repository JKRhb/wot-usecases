# [DRAFT] Process for WoT Spec generation starting with Use Case definition

To generate expected deliverable specification documents smoothly, we should define several key phases for specification generation and clarify what to do in each phase.

We could manage the following phases using GitHub's Project capability like the [Strategy Pipline](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2).

## Basic seven phases
1. Use Case Definition
2. Requirement Extraction
3. Gap Analysis
4. Feature Definition
5. Specification Generation
6. Testing
7. Publication
8. Backlog


## Use Case Definition

Who is in charge of this phase: Use Cases TF (with potential external collaborators)

This phase is the starting point of W3C spec generation.

Brainstorming, ideas, news headlines, contacts, etc., can go here to see if they spark ideas from others or combine with work in progress. Anyone in the community including non-Members can add to this column by opening a new issue in the repository. The Use Cases TF Lead takes the lead for curating ideas that have been added.

When the Use Cases TF Lead and the Use Cases TF participants determine that the proposed use case idea has concrete description, and gets an assignee to lead the discussion around requireents based on the use case description, the Use Cases TF should move it to the Requirements phase.

Unassigned items will be put lower priority (and possibly go to the bottom of the column of a possible WoT Spec Pipeline GitHub Project). The Use Cases TF Lead collaboratively with the WoT WG/IG Chairs will review the column periodically, at which point unassigned items can: get an assignee, conclude strategy work with "no further action", or stay put. Items that stay unassigned for several review periods will move to a "Backlog" phase.


## Requirement Extraction

Who is in charge of this phase: Use Cases TF (with potential external collaborators)

Once a use case description gets enough content, it can be moved to this phase.

The purpose of this phase is extracting neessary requirements from the proposed use case description.

...

## Gap Analysis

Who is in charge of this phase: whole WoT WG (collaboratively with WoT IG)

Once necessary requirements are clarified and get enough content, it can be moved to this phase.

The purpose of this phase is checking if the extracted requirements are already defined by some existing standard(s).

If there is a similar standard but it can't be directly applied, the reason should be also clarified.

...


## Feature Definition

Who is in charge of this phase: each spec TF (collaboratively with the whole WoT-WG/IG)

...

## Specification Generation

Who is in charge of this phase: each spec TF (collaboratively with the whole WoT-WG/IG)

...

## Testing

Who is in charge of this phase: each spec TF (collaboratively with the whole WoT-WG/IG)

Generate (1) a draft implementation report including feature assertions for the Candidate Recommendation publication and (2) fixed implementation report for the Proposed Recommendation publication.

Group Notes can skip this phase.

...

## Publication

Who is in charge of this phase: WoT-WG/IG Chairs, WoT Team Contact, TF Leads (as Editors)

Work with the W3C Team to follow the W3C Process to publish the specification. Specific procedure is required depending on the document's maturity level.
