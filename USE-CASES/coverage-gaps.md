# Use case coverage - Gaps to consider for next WG charter

## Geolocation

vocabulary
geofencing
static geolocation
dynamic geolocation
proximity; ad-hoc, e.g. bluetooth device identifies user is at home
semantic location format, e.g. (BiM)  / additional ontologies + data format/historical data
topology
indoor/outdoor geolocation
FoI; feature of interest (as in SSN);
semantic query
geopose - orientation

## Protocol Bindings

### other IOT standards and ecosystems
* BACnet
* KNX
* Modbus
* ECHONET Lite Web API Binding
* OPC-UA Binding Template
* Hybridcast Binding
* emerging standards, e.g. Matter

### Low level protocols and connection mechanisms
* LPWAN and SDI 12 usage in WoT
* websocket or SSE since a dashboard on a browser would be limited if we only have HTTP
* multicast

## Onboarding, Security and trust
IoT trust ontology
access control; roles/scopes; onboarding
more implementation needed for different flows

## Complex interactions, thing graphs
orchestration / aggregation / automation rules
behavior description
service interconnection
links between TDs
Groups of devices and linking (virtual compositions)

## Digital twins, twin graphs
device shadow / historical data
connected&disconnected status / time series/historical data /units/battery level/
links between TDs
service interconnection

## Metrics/Ontologies
data-based; trust metrics; (indoor) geolocation; semantic query
data-driven; latency/metric ranking
additional ontologies for location / temperature
relative values/precision

## UI
hint for UI elements / geolocation / timestamps
hint for UI elements / indoor location
hint for UI elements /geolocation
ui preference description

## Accessibility
sensory modalities
alternative I/O


## Video
video streaming
video streaming protocol binding template
"Video streaming binding/email and sms binding, image payload formats"

## Onboarding
onboarding; registration

## Miscellaneous
Usage cycle description
embedding of application-specific metadata 
presence; context
roles/scopes; onboarding
sensory modalities
simple rules/automatic onboarding/configuration
