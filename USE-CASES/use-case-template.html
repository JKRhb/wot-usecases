<!--Provide a description of the problem that is solved by the use case and a reason why this use case is important for the users -->
&lt;This use case is related to the semantic modeling of trustworthy IoT entities in energy-efficient cultural spaces such as museums. 
  Nowadays, energy-saving issues have awakened the research community's interest due to the more and more increasing global electricity demand. An excessive
use of energy is believed to derive from public and industrial buildings to cover their daily load requirements in the context of the provision of their services.
Thus, the necessity of developing energy-efficient buildings could be proved beneficial. Notably, the improvement of buildings' energy efficiency leads to Building
Energy Management Systems (BEMS). BEMS objectives include but not limited to: 
  a) the continuous management of energy towards energy consumption optimization; 
  b) the optimization of buildings' visiting conditions towards enhancing visitors experience and comfort, 
  c) the optimization of buildings' environmental conditions towards the protection and preservation of artifacts (indirect contribution).  
The application of BEMS in the context of energy-saving at cultural spaces, and especially at the museums' spaces, is an evolving recent research in-
terest. The protection and preservation of artworks and ancient objects isolated in museums, leads to the necessity of continuous monitoring of the environmental
factors and indoor conditions like temperature, humidity and CO2. This monitoring involves Internet of Things (IoT) entities, which may be considered as an
integral part of BEMS, to reduce energy consumption without: a) sacrificing humans' visiting experience and comfort indoor levels, and b) sacrificing artworks'
protection and preservation.
  The aim of the presented use case is to sketch and highlight the following requirements for knowledge representation: 
  a) representing knowledge related to the trustworthy IoT entities that are deployed in a museum i.e., things (e.g, exhibits, spaces), sensors, actuators, people, data, applications; 
  b) dealing with entities' heterogeneity via semantic interoperability and integration, especially for 'smart' museum applications and generated data; 
  c) representing knowledge related to saving energy e.g., lights, air-conditioning; 
  d) representing knowledge related to museum visits and visitors towards enhancing visiting experience while preserving comfort; 
  e) representing knowledge related to environmental conditions towards protecting and preserving museum artwork via continuous monitoring.
