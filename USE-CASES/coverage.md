# Analysis of spec coverage of use cases

Purpose of the ![coverage.csv] file is to identify coverage of use cases by the 1.1 versions of the WoT specifications.

All spec editors are requested to assess the coverage of use cases by their specification.
It is likely that the same gaps and new requirements are identified multiple times for different use cases.
