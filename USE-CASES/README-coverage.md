The coverade.csv file is intended to identify specification gaps to drive future standardisation work.

It is the groundwork for new requirements, which will be described in the REQUIREMENTS subdirectory in the corresponding template.
There will be duplicates in the table, this is expected.

The table has some initial contents that can help as examples for some identified gaps.

Please use the following conventions:

* Use N/A, if the requirement does not affect y deliverable.
* Use the comment column to describe open issues, questions.
* Use "-" if there is no gap on your deliverable.
* Do not use "," to separate entries in a single column, use "/" instead.
