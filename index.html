			The Web of Things is applicable to multiple IoT domains,
			including Smart Home, Industrial, Smart City, Retail, and Health
			applications, where usage of the W3C WoT standards can simplify the
			development of IoT systems that combine devices from multiple vendors
			and ecosystems.
			During the last charter period of the WoT Working Group several 
			specifications were developed to address requirements for
			these domains.
		</p>
		<p>
			This Use Case and Requirements Document is created
			to collect new IoT use cases from various domains
			that have been contributed by various stakeholders.
			These serve as a baseline for identifying requirements

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has published the Web of Things
			(WoT) Architecture and Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description (TD) as
			official W3C Recommendations in May 2020. These specifications enable
			easy integration across Internet of Things platforms and applications.
		</p>
        <p>The W3C Web of Thing Architecture [[wot-architecture]] defines an
            abstract architecture, the WoT Thing Description [[wot-thing-description]] 
            defines a format to describes a broad spectrum of very different devices, 
            which may be connected over various protocols.
         </p>
         <p>
            During the inception phase of the WoT 1.0 specifications in 2017-2018
            the WoT IG collected use cases and requirements to enable 
            interoperability of Internet of Things (IoT) 
			services on a worldwide basis.
            Thes released specifications have been created to address the 
            use cases and requirements for the first version of the WoT specifications,
            which are documented in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot/ucr-doc/">
            https://w3c.github.io/wot/ucr-doc/</a>

<h4>Motivation</h4>

Integrating and interconnecting multiple devices into the common retail workflow 
(i.e., transaction log) drastically improves retail business operations at multiple levels. 
It brings operational visibility,including consumer behavior and environmental information, 
that was not previously possible or viable in a meaningful way. 

It drastically speeds up the process of root cause analysis of operational issues and 
simplifies the work of retailers.

<section id="retail-description">
<h4>Description</h4>

Falling costs of sensors, communications, and handling of very large volumes of data combined with cloud 
computing enable retail business operations with increased operational efficiency, better customer service, 
and even increased revenue growth and return on investment.

Accurate forecasts allow retailers to coordinate demand-driven outcomes that deliver connected customer interactions.
They drive optimal strategies in planning, increasing inventory productivity in retail supply chains, 
decreasing operational costs and driving customer satisfaction from engagement, to sale, to fulfilment. 

Understanding of store activity juxtaposed with traditional information streams can boost worker and consumer safety, 
comply better with work safety regulations, enhance system and site security, and improve worker efficiency 
by providing real-time visibility into worker status, location, and work environment.

<section id="retail-security considerations">
<h4>Security Considerations</h4>

<ul>
<li>In retail, replay attacks can cause monetary loss, customers may be incorrectly charged or over-charged.</li>
<li>To avoid replay attacks, "Things" should implement a sequence number for each message and digital signature.</li>
<li>Servers ("Things" or "Cloud") should verify the signature and disallow for duplicated messages.</li>
<li>For "Things" relying on electronic payments, "Things" must comply with PCI-DSS requirements.</li>
<li>"Things" must never store credit card information.</li>
<li>Customer satisfaction and trust depends on availability, so attacks such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) need to be prevented or mitigated.</li>
<li>To prevent DoS, implement "Things" with early DoS detection.</li>
<li>Have an automated DoS system that will notify the controlling unit of the problem.</li>
<li>Implement IP white list, that could be part of the DoS early detection system.</li>
<li>Make sure your network perimeter is defended with up to date firewall software.</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section id="retail-privacy considerations">
<h4>Privacy Considerations</h4>
 
As a general rule, personal consumer information should not be stored.
That is especially true in the retail industry where a security breach could cause financial, reputation, and brand damage.
If personal or information that can identify a consumer is to be stored,
it should be to conduct business and with the explicit acknowledgment of the consumer.
WoT vendors and integrators should always have a privacy policy and make it easily available.
By default, devices should adopt an opt-out policy.
That means, unless the consumer explicitly allowed for the data capture and storage, avoid doing it.

&lt;Provide a description of the problem that is solved by the use case and a reason why this use case is important for the users&gt;

A lot of home devices, such as TV, cleaner, and home lighting, connect to an IP network.
When you watch a content program, these devices should coorperate for enhancing your expereence.

If the cleaning robot makes a loud noise while watching the TV program, it will hinder viewing. 
Also, even if you set up the theater environment with smart lights, it is troublesome to operate it yourself each time the TV program switches.

Therefore, by WoT device to operate in accordance with the TV program being viewed, thereby improving the user experience.

WoT devices work according to TV programs:

<ul>
<li>Cleaning robot stops at an important situation,</li>
<li>Color of smart lights are changed according to TV programs,</li>
<li>Smart Mirror is notified that favorite TV show will start.</li>

<section id="mmi-1-1_audiovisual-devices-as-smartphone-extensions-motivation">
<h4>Motivation</h4>

Many of today's home IoT-enabled devices can provide similar functionality
(e.g. audio/video playback),
differing only in certain aspects of the user interface.
This use case would allow continuous interaction with a specific
application as the user moves from room to room,
with the user interface switched automatically to the set of
devices available in the user's present location.

On the other hand, 
some devices can have specific capabilities 
and user interfaces that can be used to add information to a larger context
that can be reused by other applications and devices.
This drives the need to spread an application across different devices
to achieve a more user-adapted and meaningful interaction according to the 
context of use.
Both aspects provide arguments for exploring use cases where
applications use distributed multimodal interfaces.

</section>

<section id="mmi-1-1_audiovisual-devices-as-smartphone-extensions-expected devices">
<h4>Expected Devices</h4>

Mobile phone or other client running an application requiring a extended and
more accessible user interface.

IoT-enabled audio-visual devices providing audio and visual information
display capabilities that can be used to augment the user interface of the 
application.

Possible edge computation services providing speech-to-text or described video
(e.g. object detection) capabilities.

</section>

<section id="mmi-1-1_audiovisual-devices-as-smartphone-extensions-expected data">
<h4>Expected Data</h4>

Visual display information mapping information from audio to visual modalities,
for example text generated from voice recognition.

Text from an application that needs to be displayed at a larger size.

Visual alerts correspondig to audio stimuli, eg sound effects in a game mapped
to visual icons.

Visual information mapped to audio information, for example,
described video based on an AI service providing object recognition.

<section id="mmi-1-1_audiovisual-devices-as-smartphone-extensions-description">
<h4>Description</h4>

A home entertainment system is adapted by a mobile device
as a set of user interface components.

In addition to media rendering and playback,
these Devices also act as input or output modalities for
an application, for example an application running on a smartphone.
The native user interface on the application 
does not have to be manipulated directly at all.
A wall-mounted touch-sensitive TV could be used to navigate applications,
and a wide-range microphone can handle speech input.
Spatial (Kinect-style) gestures may also be used to control 
application behavior.

Accessibility support software on the smartphone 
discovers available modalities and arranges them to best 
serve the user's purpose. 
One display can be used to show photos and movies, 
another for navigation. 
As the user walks into another room, 
this configuration is adapted dynamically to the new location. 
User intervention may be sometimes required to decide on 
the most convenient modality configuration. 
The state of the interaction is maintained 
while switching between modality sets. 
For example, 
if the user was navigating a GUI menu in the living room, 
it is carried over to another screen when she switches rooms, 
or replaced with a different modality such as voice 
if there are no displays in the new location.

#### Variants:

Modalities may be translated from one form to another to accomodate
accessibility issues, for example, visual cues into audio cues and 
vice-versa, as appropriate.

The increase in the number of controllable devices in an
intelligent home creates a problem with controlling all available services
in a coherent and useful manner.
Having a shared context,
built from information collected through sensors and direct user input,
 would improve recognition of user intent, and thus simplify interactions.

multiple input mechanisms could be selected by the user based on device type,
level of trust and the type of interaction required for a particular task.

Smart home functionality (window blinds, lights, air conditioning etc.)
is controlled through a multimodal interface,
composed from modalities built into the house itself
(e.g. speech and gesture recognition)
and those available on the user's personal devices
(e.g. smartphone touchscreen).
The system may automatically adapt to the preferences of a specific user,
or enter a more complex interaction if multiple people are present.

Sensors built into various devices around the house can act as input
modalities that feed information to the home and affect its behavior.
For example,
lights and temperature in the gym room can be adapted dynamically
as workout intensity recorded by the fitness equipment increases.
The same data can also increase or decrease volume and tempo of music tracks
played by the user's mobile device or the home's media system.

#### Variants:

The intelligent home in tandem with the user's personal
devices can additionally monitor user behavior for emotional patterns
such as 'tired' or 'busy' and adapt further.

<h4>Motivation</h4>

User interface personalization is a task that most often needs to be repeated
for all Devices a user wishes to interact with recurringly.
With complex devices,
this task can also be very time-consuming,
which is problematic if the user regularly accesses similar,
but not identical devices, as in the case of several cars rented over a month.

A standardized set of personal information and preferences that could be used
to configure personalizable devices automatically would be very helpful for all
these cases in which the interaction becomes a customary practice.

<h4>Description</h4>

Basic in-car functionality is standardized to be managed by other devices.
A user can control seat, radio or AC settings through a personalized multimodal interface
shared by the car and her personal mobile device.
User preferences are stored on the mobile Device (or in the cloud),
and can be transferred across different car models handling a specific functionality
(e.g. all cars with touchscreens should be able to adapt to a "high contrast" preference).

The car can make itself available as a complex modality component that wraps around all
functionality and supported modalities,
or as a collection of modality components such as touchscreen, speech recognition system,
or audio player.
In the latter case,
certain user preferences may be shared with other environments.

For example,
a user may opt to select the "high contrast" scheme at night on all of her displays,
in the car or at home.
A car that provides a set of modalities can be also adapted by the mobile device
to compose an interface for its functionality,
for example to manage playback of music tracks through the car's voice control system.
Sensor data provided by the phone can be mixed with data recorded by the car's own sensors
to profile user behavior which can be used as context in multimodal interaction.

#### Variants:

Additional portable devices may be brought into the car and also be
incorporated into an application, for example, a GPS navigation system.

A smart grid integrates all players in the electricity market into one overall system through the interaction of generation, storage, grid management and consumption. Power and storage plants are already controlled today in such a way that only as much electricity is produced as is needed. Smart grids include consumers as well as small, decentralized energy suppliers and storage locations in this control system, so that on the one hand, consumption is more homogeneous in terms of time and space (see also intelligent electricity consumption) and on the other hand, in principle inhomogeneous producers (e.g. wind power) and consumers (e.g. lighting) can be better integrated.

<section id="smart-grid-description">
<h4>Description</h4>

The term Smart Grid refers to the communicative networking and control of power generators, storage facilities, electrical consumers, and grid equipment in power transmission and distribution networks for electricity supply. This enables the optimization and monitoring of the interconnected components. The aim is to secure the energy supply on the basis of efficient and reliable system operation.

#### Variants:

##### Decentralized Power Generation
While electricity grids with centralized power generation have dominated up to now, the trend is moving towards decentralized generation plants, both for generation from fossil primary energy through small CHP plants and for generation from renewable sources such as photovoltaic systems, solar thermal power plants, wind turbines and biogas plants. This leads to a much more complex structure, primarily in the area of load control, voltage maintenance in the distribution grid and maintenance of grid stability. In contrast to medium to large power plants, smaller, decentralised generation plants also feed directly into the lower voltage levels such as the low-voltage grid or the medium-voltage grid. This use case variants also includes operation and control of energy storages like batteries.

##### Virtual Power Plants
A Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is an aggregation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) that can act as an entity on energy markets or as an ancillary service to grid operation.
The individual DERs often have a primary use on their own, with electric generation/consumption being a side-effect resp. secondary use. This results in negotiations/collaborations between many different parties e.g. such as the DER owner, the VPP operator, the grid operator and others.

##### Smart Metering
For consumers, a major change is the installation of smart meters. Their core tasks are remote reading and the possibility to realize fluctuating prices within a day at short notice. All electricity meters must therefore be replaced by those with remote data transmission.

##### Other variants
Emergency response, grid synchronization, grid black start

</section>

<section id="smart-grid-building blocks">
<h4>Building Blocks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Multi-Stakeholder Operation: Multiple involved parties have to find a common mode of operation</li>
<li>Device Lifecycle Management: Since the VPP is a dynamic system of loosely coupled DERs, the appearance and disappearance of DERs as well as the software management on the devices itself requires a means to orchestrate the lifecycle of individual device's respective components.</li>
<li>Embedded Runtime: Especially for DERs in remote locations, maintaining a close couple control loop can be expensive if feasible at all. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to offload control logic to the DER itself.</li>
<li>Ensemble Discovery: In order to dynamically find matching DERs needed for the operational goal of a VPP, a registry with different options of DER discovery is needed.</li>
<li>Content-Negotiation: The different stakeholders have to interact and therefore need a common data format.</li>
<li>Resource Description: The DER has to describe itself to enable discovery of single DERs and ensembles, also the operational data needs to be understood by the different stakeholders without engineering effort.</li>
<li>Push Services: As there is a fan-out with many devices that probably have a rate-limited connection connecting to one single command centre, a bidirectional communication mechanism is needed rather than polling for the reverse direction</li>
<li>Object Memory: As multiple and interchangable stakeholders are involved in the application, a backlog of the object is beneficial for scrollkeeping</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section id="smart-grid-non-functionals">
<h4>Non-Functionals</h4>
<ul>
<li>Privacy: As fine-grained metering informtion provides sensitive data about a household, the system should show a high digree of privacy</li>
<li>Trust: Since the data exchange between the virtual power plant and the distributed energy resource leads to a physical action that invokes high currents and monetary flows, the integrity of both parties and the exchange's data is crucial</li>
<li>Layered L7 Communication: Since multiple different links are used for monitoring and control, integration requires a clear and consistent seperation of information from the used serialization and application protocols to enable the exchange of homogenous information over heterogenous application layer protocols</li>

<h4>Motivation</h4>

Construction and renovation companies often deal with the challenge of delivering target energy-efficient buildings given specific budget and time constraints. Energy efficiency, as one of the key factors for renovation investments, depends on the availability of various data sources to support the renovation design and planning. These include climate data and building material along with residential comfort and energy consumption profiles. The profiles are created using a combination of manual inputs and sensory data collected from residents.

<section id="connected-building-energy-efficiency-description">
<h4>Description</h4>

Renovation of residential buildings to improve energy efficiency depend on a wide range of sensory information to understand the building conditions and consumption models. As part of the pre-renovation activities, the renovation companies deploy various sensors to collect relevant data over a period of time. Such sensors become part of a wireless sensor network (WSN) and expose data endpoint with the help of one or more gateway devices. Depending on the protocols, the endpoints require different interaction flows to securely access the current and historical measurements. The renovation applications need to discover the sensors, their endpoints and how to interact with them based on search criteria such as the physical location, mapping to the building model or measurement type.

<li>various identifiers for each thing (e.g. sensor serial number, z-wave ID, SenML name)</li>

It enables third-party applications to obtain limited access to HTTP services on behalf of the resource owner 
or of itself. 
The protocol defines the following actors:

<ul>
<li>Client: an application that wants to use a resource owned by the resource owner. </li>
<li>Authorization Server: An intermediary that authorizes the client for a particular `scope`. </li>
<li>Resource: a web resource </li>
<li>Resource Server: the server where the resource is stored</li>
<li>Resource Owner: the owner of a particular web resource. If it is a human is usually referred to as an end-user.</li>
</ul>
  More specifically from the RFC:
  &gt;  An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.


These actors can be mapped to WoT entities: 
<ul>
<li>Client is a WoT Consumer</li>
<li>Authorization Server is a third-party service</li>
<li>Resource is an interaction affordance</li>
<li>Resource Server is a Thing described by a Thing Description acting as a server.  </li>
</ul>
  May be a device or a service.
<ul>
<li>Resource Owner might be different in each use case.</li>
</ul>
  A Thing Description may also combine resources from different owners or web server.
  
TO DO: Check the OAuth 2.0 spec to determine exactly how Resource Owner is defined.
Is it the actual owner of the resource (eg running the web server) or simply someone
with the rights to access that resource?

The OAuth 2.0 protocol specifies an authorization layer that separates the client from the resource owner.
The basic steps of this protocol are summarized in the following diagram:

     +--------+                               +---------------+
     |        |--(A)- Authorization Request -&gt;|   Resource    |
     |        |                               |     Owner     |
     |        |&lt;-(B)-- Authorization Grant ---|               |
     |        |                               +---------------+
     |        |
     |        |                               +---------------+
     |        |--(C)-- Authorization Grant --&gt;| Authorization |
     | Client |                               |     Server    |
     |        |&lt;-(D)----- Access Token -------|               |
     |        |                               +---------------+
     |        |
     |        |                               +---------------+
     |        |--(E)----- Access Token ------&gt;|    Resource   |
     |        |                               |     Server    |
     |        |&lt;-(F)--- Protected Resource ---|               |
     +--------+                               +---------------+

Steps A and B defines what is known as authorization grant type or flow.
What is important to realize here is that not all of these interactions
are meant to take place over a network protocol.
In some cases,
interaction with with a human through a user interface may be intended.

OAuth2.0 defines 4 basic flows plus an extension mechanism.
The most common of which are:
<ul>
<li>`code`</li>
<li>`implicit`</li>
<li>`password` (of resource owner)</li>
<li>`client` (credentials of the client)</li>
</ul>

In addition, a particular extension which is of interest to IoT is the `device` flow.

Further information about the OAuth 2.0 protocol can be found in
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1">IETF RFC6749</a>.
In addition to the flows, OAuth 2.0 also supports scopes.
Scopes are identifiers which can be attached to tokens.
These can be used to limit authorizations to
particular roles or actions in an API.
Each token carries a set of scopes and these can be checked when an interaction
is attempted and access can be denied if the token does not include a scope
required by the interaction.

This document describes relevant use cases for each of the OAuth 2.0 authorization flows.

<section id="oauth-expected devices">
<h4>Expected Devices</h4>

To support OAuth 2.0, all devices must have the capability of: 
<ul>
<li>Both the producer and consumer must be able to create and participate in a TLS connection.</li>
<li>The producer must be able to verify an access (bearer) token (i.e. have sufficient computational power/connectivity). </li>
</ul>

Comment: 
<ul>
<li>Investigate whether DTLS can be used.</li>
</ul>
  Certainly the connection needs to be encrypted; this is required in the OAuth 2.0 specification.
<ul>
<li>Investigate whether protocols other than HTTP can be used, e.g. CoAP.</li>
</ul>
  - found an interesting IETF draft RFC about CoAP  support(encrypted using various mechanisms like DTLS or CBOR Object Signing and Encryption): <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-35">draft-ietf-ace-oauth</a>

</section>

<section id="oauth-expected data">
<h4>Expected Data</h4>

Depending on the OAuth 2.0 flow specified, various URLs and elements need to be specified,
for example, the location of an authorization token server.
OAuth 2.0 is also based on bearer tokens and so
needs to include the same data as those, for example, expected encryption suite.
Finally,
OAuth 2.0 supports scopes so these need to be defined in the security scheme and specified in
the form.

<h4>Description</h4>

A general use case for OAuth 2.0 is when a WoT consumer wants to access restricted interaction affordances.
In particular, when those affordances have a specific resource owner which 
may grant some temporary permissions to the consumer.  

The WoT consumer can either be hosted in a remote device or interact directly with the end-user inside an application.

#### Variants:

For each OAuth 2.0 flow, there is a corresponding use case variant.
We also include the experimental "device" flow for consideration.

##### code

A natural application of this protocol is when the end-user wants to interact directly with the consumed thing or to grant his authorization to a remote device. In fact from the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1">RFC6749</a>

&gt; Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
   interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
   browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
   from the authorization server.


This implies that the code flow can be only used when the resource owner interacts directly with the WoT consumer at least once. Typical scenarios are:

<ul>
<li>In a home automation context, a device owner uses a third party software to interact with/orchestrate one or more devices</li>
<li>Similarly, in a smart farm, the device owner might delegate its authorization to third party services.</li>
<li>In a smart home scenario, Thing Description Directories might be deployed using this authorization mechanism. In particular, the list of the registered TDs might  require an explicit read authorization request to the device owner (i.e. an human who has bought the device and installed it). </li>
<li>...   </li>
</ul>

The following diagram shows the steps of the protocol adapted to WoT idioms and entities. In this scenario, the WoT Consumer has read the Thing Description of a Remote Device and want to access one of its WoT Affordances protected with OAuth 2.0 code flow.

Notice that steps (A), (B) and (C) are broken in two parts as they pass through the User-Agent. 


##### device

The device flow (IETF <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628#section-6.2) briefly describes an authentication using a companion app and BLE), as shown in the following (slightly adapted">RFC 8628](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628)) is a variant of the code flow for browserless and input-constrained devices. Similarly, to its *parent* flow, it requires a close interaction between the resource owner and the WoT consumer. Therefore, the use cases for this flow are the same as the code authorization grant but restricted to all devices that do not have a rich means to interact with the resource owner. However, differently from `code`, RFC 8628 states explicitly that one of the actors of the protocol is an **end-user** interacting with a **browser** (even if [section-6.2</a> diagram:

```
Notable mentions:
<ul>
<li>the protocol is heavily end-user oriented. In fact, the RFC states the following</li>
</ul>
  &gt; Due to the polling nature of this protocol (as specified in Section 3.4), care is needed to avoid overloading the capacity of the token endpoint.  To avoid unneeded requests on the token endpoint, the client SHOULD only commence a device authorization request when **prompted by the user and not automatically**, such as when the app starts or when the previous authorization session expires or fails.
<ul>
<li>TLS is required both between WoT Consumer/Authorization Server and between Browser/Authorization Server</li>
<li>Other user interactions methods may be used but are left out of scope</li>
</ul>


##### client credential
The Client Credentials grant type is used by clients to obtain an access token outside of the context of an end-user. From <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4">RFC6749</a>:

&gt;  The client can request an access token using only its client
   credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when the
   the client is requesting access to the protected resources under its
   control, or __those of another resource owner that has been previously
   arranged with the authorization server__ (the method of which is beyond
   the scope of this specification).

Therefore the client credential grant can be used:
<ul>
<li>When the resource owner is a public authority. For example, in a smart city context, the authority provides a web service where to register an application id.</li>
<li>Companion application</li>
<li>Industrial IoT. Consider a smart factory where the devices or services are provisioned with client credentials. </li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

The Client Credentials flow is illustrated in the following diagram. Notice how the Resource Owner is not present.

|          |                                  +---------------+
+----------+
```

Comment: Usually client credentials are distributed using an external service which is used by humans to register a particular application. For example, the `npm` cli has a companion dashboard where a developer requests the generation of a token that is then passed to the cli. The token is used to verify the publishing process of `npm` packages in the registry. Further examples are Docker cli and OpenId Connect Client Credentials. 

##### implicit
**Deprecated**
From  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-15#section-2.1.2">OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice</a>:

&gt; In order to avoid these issues, clients SHOULD NOT use the implicit
   grant (response type "token") or other response types issuing access
   tokens in the authorization response, unless access token injection
   in the authorization, response is prevented and the aforementioned
   token leakage vectors are mitigated.

The RFC above suggests using `code` flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) instead. 

The implicit flow was designed for public clients typically implemented inside a browser (i.e. javascript clients). As the `code` is a redirection-based flow and it requires direct interaction with the resource's owner user-agent. However, it requires one less step to obtain a token as it is returned directly in the authentication request (see the diagram below).

Considering the WoT context this flow is not particularly different from `code` grant and it can be used in the same scenarios.  

Comment: even if the `implicit` flow is deprecated existing services may still using it.

##### resource owner password
**Deprecated** From  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-15#section-2.1.2">OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice</a>:

&gt; The resource owner password credentials grant MUST NOT be used.  This
   grant type insecurely exposes the credentials of the resource owner
   to the client.  Even if the client is benign, this results in an
   increased attack surface (credentials can leak in more places than
   just the AS) and users are trained to enter their credentials in
   places other than the AS.

For completeness the diagram flow is reported below.

<h4>Security Considerations</h4>

See OAuth 2.0 security considerations in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628#section-5">RFC6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10). See also [RFC 8628 section 5</a> for `device` flow.

<section id="oauth-privacy considerations">
<h4>Privacy Considerations</h4>

&lt;Describe any issues related to privacy; if there are none, say "none" and justify&gt;

</section>

<section id="oauth-gaps">
<h4>Gaps</h4>

&lt;Describe any gaps that are not addressed in the current WoT standards and building blocks&gt;

</section>

<section id="device-lifecycle-description">
<h4>Description</h4>

Handle the entire device lifecycle: 
Define terminology for lifecycle states and transitions.

#### Actors (represent a physical person or group of persons (company))
Manufacturer
Service Provider
Network Provider (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)
Device Owner (User)
Others?

#### Roles:
Depending on the use case, an actor can have multiple roles, 
e.g. security maintainer.  
Roles can be delegated.

#### Variants:

There are (at least) two different entities to consider:
<ul>
<li>Things / Devices</li>
<li>Consumers, e.g. cloud services or gateways</li>
</ul>

In more complex use cases there are additional entities:
<ul>
<li>Intermediates</li>
<li>Directories</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section id="device-lifecycle-gaps">
<h4>Gaps</h4>

The current architecture spec does not describe device lifecycle in detail.
A common lifecycle model helps to clarify terminology and structures the discussion
in different groups.
Interaction of a device with other entities such as directories may introduce 
additional states and transitions.
