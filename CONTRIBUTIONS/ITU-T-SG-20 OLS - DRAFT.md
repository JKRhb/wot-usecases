The mission of the W3C Web of Things is to counter the fragmentation 
of the IoT through the specification of building blocks that enable 
easy integration of IoT devices and services across IoT platforms and application domains. 

These building blocks should complement and enhance existing standards.

Two baseline specifications have been developed since the launch of the Web of Things Working Group.
They define an abstract architecture, a common data format for describing IoT devices and services, 
and several building blocks that increase interoperability 
for IoT applications and reduce integration efforts and costs:

- The WoT Architecture describes the overall Web of Things conceptual framework.
- The WoT Thing Description is a description format for a physical or virtual Thing/device.

The WoT group recently started conversations with ITU-T SG 20, since both groups address 
the Web of Things problem space.

We consider it important to exchange informatino on use cases and requirements 
across standardisation organisations
and seek to align terminology and
