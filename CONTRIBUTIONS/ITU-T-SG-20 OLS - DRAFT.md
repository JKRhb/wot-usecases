== W3C INTERNAL DRAFT ONLY ===

The mission of the W3C Web of Things is to counter the fragmentation 
of the IoT through the specification of building blocks that enable 
easy integration of IoT devices and services across IoT platforms and application domains. 

These building blocks should complement and enhance existing standards.

Two baseline specifications have been developed since the launch of the Web of Things Standardisation Activities.
They define an abstract architecture, a common data format for describing IoT devices and services, 
and several building blocks that increase interoperability 
for IoT applications and reduce integration efforts and costs:

- The WoT Architecture describes the overall Web of Things conceptual framework.
- The WoT Thing Description is a description format for a physical or virtual Thing/device.

The W3C WoT group recently started conversations with ITU-T SG 20, since both groups address 
the Web of Things problem space.

We consider it important to exchange information on use cases and requirements 
across standardisation organisations and seek to align terminology to avoid fragmentation and confusion.

For an introduction of the use cases we are considering for the current charter period
we provide the WoT Use Cases document for information.

We would appreciate if ITU-T considers areas where exchange of further information 
(e.g. draft documents, requirements, etc.) can be useful to reduce fragmentation of IoT/WoT.

We are interested in your ongoing work, e.g. healthcare use cases, and seek to align our work efforts.
