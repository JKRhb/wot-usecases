This directory contains the use cases 
for the next revision (V1.1) of the WoT architecture.

Please put all your use cases into this directory adopting the format in the template [use-case-template.md](use-case-template.md).

Please avoid domain specific terminology, e.g. don't use MNO, telco. Better use network operator instead.

# Terminology

We use common terminology across the use cases to make sure 
everybody has the same understanding and the descriptions match
when we combine the use case in a single document.
