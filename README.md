## Announcement: 
The Web of Things Use Cases Task force will be reorganized for the new charter. 
Currently we are working on the requirements process and are not actively
seeking new use cases, but if you want to contribute one contact us (see below).

General information about the Web of Things can be found on https://www.w3.org/WoT/.
  
---
The WoT Use Case task force is responsible for collecting use cases for WoT and extracting requirements. Use cases can include both specific vertical applications and relevant technologies or other horizontal usage patterns. Guests who are not WoT members but who have an interest in specific vertical application domains, technologies, or usage patterns are explicitly invited to engage with this task force to provide input.

If you would like to participate please contact the chairs at team-wot@w3.org.

## Repository Information

All work on the Use Cases document is happening in this repository. 
It includes various use case proposals and a consolidated document based on those proposals.

Each commit here will sync it to the master, which will expose the content to http://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/.

## Contributing

** At the moment the Use Cases TF is defining the policy for the next WG charter, potential contributors are asked not to
create pull requests with new contributions until the next charter period begins. Ideas can still be proposed, but the review and
inclusion might be delayed.

Please document new **use cases** in the [USE-CASES](USE-CASES) directory adopting the template [use-case-template.md](USE-CASES/use-case-template.md) (Markdown) or [use-case-template.html](USE-CASES/use-case-template.html) (HTML). The HTML template is the preferred form.

Describe new **requirements** in the [REQUIREMENTS](REQUIREMENTS) directory using the template [requirements-template.md](REQUIREMENTS/requirements.md) (Markdown) or [requirements-template.html](REQUIREMENTS/requirements.html) (HTML). The HTML template is the preferred form.

Put all other contributions in the [CONTRIBUTIONS](CONTRIBUTIONS) directory using an open file format, e.g.text, markdown, html, svg.

To make direct changes to the IG document, please provide pull-requests to the html file, see [github help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
