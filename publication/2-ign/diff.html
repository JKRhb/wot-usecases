<h2>
Abstract
</h2>
<p>
The
Web
of
Things
is
applicable
to
multiple
IoT
domains,
including
Smart
Home,
Industrial,
Smart
City,
Retail,
and
Health
applications,
where
usage
of
the
<abbr title= "World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
WoT
standards
can
simplify
the
development
of
IoT
systems
that
combine
devices
from
multiple
vendors
and
ecosystems.
During
the
last
charter
period
of
the
WoT
Working
Group
several
specifications
were
developed
to
address
requirements
for
these
domains.
</p>
<p>
This
Use
Cases
and
Requirements
Document
is
created
to
collect
new
IoT
use
cases
from
various
domains
that
have
been
contributed
by
various
stakeholders.
These
serve
as
a
baseline
for
identifying
requirements
for
the
standardization
work
in
the
<abbr title= "World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
WoT
groups.

<p>
During
the

specifications
in
2017-2018
the
WoT
IG
collected
use

and
requirements
to
enable
interoperability
of
Internet

(IoT)
services
on
a
worldwide
basis.
These
released
specifications
have
been
created
to
address
the
use
cases
and
requirements
for
the
first
version
of
the
WoT

which
are
documented
in

gathers
and
describes
new
use

and
requirements
for
future
standardization
work
in
the
WoT
standard.
</p>
<p>
This
document
contains
chapters
describing
the
use

that
were
contributed

Additionally
it
contains
a
summary
of
the
liaisons,
where
active
collaboration
is
taking
place
at
the
time
of
writing.
Since
this

Greenhouse
Horticulture
controlled

computers
can
create
an
optimal
environment
for
growing
plants.
This
enables
to
improve
productivity
and
ensure
stable
vegetable
production
throughout
the
year,
independent
of
the
weather.
This
is
the
result
of
research
on
the
growth
of
plants
in
the
1980s.
For
example,
in
tomatoes,
switching
to
hydroponics
and
optimizing
the
temperature,
humidity
and
CO2
concentration
required
for
photosynthesis
resulted
in
a
five
times
increase
in
yield.
The
growth
conditions
for
other
vegetables
also
have
been
investigated,
and
this
control
system
is
applied
now.

When

the

turns
on

to

The

The

Motivation

<dd>
Water
is
vital
for
ensuring
food
security
to
the
worldโs
population,
and
agriculture
is
the
biggest
consumer
amounting
for
70%
of
freshwater.
Field
irrigation
application
methods
are
one
of
the
main
causes
of
water
wastage.
The
most
common
technique,
surface
irrigation,
wastes
a
high
percentage
of
the
water
by
wetting
areas
where
no
plants
benefit
from
it.
On
the
other
hand,
localized
irrigation
can
use
water
more
efficiently
and
effectively,
avoiding
both
under-irrigation
and
over-irrigation.
However,
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
under-irrigation,
farmers
feed
more
water
than
is
needed
resulting
not
only
to
productivity
losses,
but
also
water
wastages.
Therefore,
technology
should
be
developed
and
deployed
for
sensing
water
needs
and
automatically
manage
water
supply
to
crops.
However,
open
field
agriculture
is
characterized
by
a
quite
dynamic
range
of
requirements.
Usually,
solutions
developed
for
one
particular
crop
type
cannot
be
reused
in
other
cultivations.
Moreover,
the
same
field
can
have
different
crop
types
or
different
sizes/shapes
during
the
years,
meaning
that
technology
to
monitor
the
state
of
crop
growth
should
be
highly
configurable
and
adaptive.
Even
agriculture
and
irrigation
methods
can
change
and
also
they
are
very
different
depending
on
the
size
of
the
field
and
its
clime
type.
Consequently,
silos
applications
are
deployed
leveraging
on
IoT
technologies
to
gather
data
about
the
crop
growth
state
and
irrigation
needs.
The
Web
of
Things
may
help
to
create
a
single
platform
where
cost-effective
applications
could
adapt
seamlessly
between
different
scenarios,
breaking
the
silos
and
giving
value
both
to
the
environment
and
the
market.

Expected
Data
</dt>
<dd>
Sensor
data
plays
a
central
role
in
Smart
Agriculture.
In
particular,
it
is
critical
that
the
information
sensed
is
associated
with
a
timestamp.
Common
algorithms
use
*time
series*
to
calculate
the
water
needs
of
a
crop.
Furthermore,
soil
sensors
usually
are
calibrated
over
a
specific
soil
type
(which
may
differ
even
in
the
same
geographic
region).
For
example,
the
calibration
data
for
a
soil
moisture
sensor
is
represented
by
a
function
that
maps
sensor
output
to
soil
water
content.
In
literature,
this
function
is
knowns
as
a
*calibration
curve*.
Commercial
sensors
are
precalibrated
with
a
"standard"
curve
but
on
most
occasions,
it
fails
to
accurately
measure
the
water
content.
Therefore,
it
can
be
configured
during
the
installation
phase
(which
may
happen
every
time
the
soil
is
plowed).
Finally,
a
crucial
aspect
is
forecasting.
Farmers
use
this
information
to
actively
change
their
management
procedures.
Services
exploit
it
to
suggest
irrigation
schedule
or
change
device
settings
to
behave
accordingly
to
environmental
changes.
To

here
it

In
open-field
agriculture,
the
IoT
solutions
leverage
on
different
radio
protocols
and
devices.
Usually,
radio
protocols
should
cover
long
distances
(even
kilometers)
and
be
energy
efficient.
Devices
too
need
to
be
energy
saving
as
they
are
deployed
for
months
and
sometimes
even
years
in
harsh
environments.
A
sleeping-cycle
is
one
mechanism
they
use
to
save
energy
usually
coordinated
by
*loggers/gateways*
or
preprogrammed.
*Loggers*
are
deployed
closed
to
sensor
devices
and
have
more
storage
space.
They
serve
as
buffers
between
sensors
and
higher
services.
Often
*loggers*
and
sensors
are
embedded
in
the
same
board,
otherwise,
they
are
connected
using
cables
or
close-ranged
radio
protocols.
On
the
other
hand,
*gateways*
serve
as
a
collection
point
for
data
of
an
entire
field
or
farm.
They
are
much
more
capable
devices
and
usually
are
more
energy-consuming.
In
some
deployment
scenarios,
they
host
a
full
operating
system
with
multiple
software
facilities
installed.
Otherwise,
gateways
only
serve
as
relays
of
data
sent
from
the
loggers
and
sensors
to
cloud
services
and
vice-versa.
The
cloud
services
may
be
partially
hosted
in
edge
servers
to
preserve
data
privacy
and
responsiveness
of
the
whole
IoT
solution.

Depending
on
the
type
of
crops
(e.g.
maize),
cultivated
plots
may
need
specific
irrigation
processes
in
outdoor
environments.
Depending
on
the
country
there
exist
some
specific
pedo-climatic
conditions
and
some
water
consumption
restrictions.
Thus
an
irrigation
system
is
installed
on
the
plot.
It
is
used
on
a
several
days
basis
(e.g.
every
7
days),
for
each
plot.
The
goal
is
to
optimize
the
irrigation
decision
based
on
the
crop
development
stage
and
the
quantity
of
rain
that
has
already
fallen
down
on
the
plot.
For

an
important
rain
may
postpone
the
irrigation
decision.

in

each

sends
several

are

The
tensiometers
and
the

The
main
potential
issues
come
from
tensiometers
located
in
the
plot,
as
they
are
known
to
be
cheap
and
easy
to
use
probes
but
not
always
reliable.
They
can
face
multiple
issues:
if
the
soil
gets
too
dry
or
the
probe
is
improperly
installed,
there
may
be
air
between
the
probe
and
the
soil,
therefore
preventing
the
probe
from
providing
accurate
conductivity
measurements.
<br />
<br />
To
be
sure
of
the
quality
of
those
measurements
each
tensiometer
sends
its
measurements
several
times
(3
to
5)
per
day.
The
tensiometer
may
send
an
inappropriate
value
due
to
the
bad
connection
between
the
soil
and
the
probe,
that
is
the
reason
why
three
tensiometers
are
used
and
the
median
value
is
computed.
If
the
gateway
does
not
receive
the
value
of
one
sensor
during
a
whole
day,
an
alert
should
be
sent.
To
take
an
irrigation
decision,
at
least
one
measurement
per
sensor
and
per
day
should
be
provided.
<br />
<br />
The
gateway
can
create
a
virtual
entity
corresponding
to
the
sensor
and
allow
the
application
to
access
this
virtual
entity
having
the
actual
sensor
status
like
sleeping.
<br />
<br />
Sensor
nodes
deployed
in
outdoor
environments
may
take
into
account
that
their
energy
supply
device
(battery,
solar
panel)
constrains
the
lifetime
of
the
device.
Thus
they
should
be
able
to
alert
that
they
may
not
be
able
to
provide
a
service
due
to
lack
of
energy
or
they
should
be
able
to
change
their
configuration
and
switch
communication
protocols
to
save
as
much
energy
as
possible.
<br />
<br />
Moreover
wireless
communication
can
be
impacted
by
weather
conditions
or
any
outdoor
conditions.
For
example
a
tractor
that
comes
too
close
to
the
sensor
node
may
move
the
communication
device
and
destroy
some
components.
Some
kind
of
network
supervision
must
be
achieved
(for
instance
by
the
gateway)
to
check
node
availability.

developed
by
Arvalis
[2]
and
INRAE
dedicated
to
France
and
some
specific
crops:
maize,
wheat
and
cereals,
potatoes
and
beans.
<br />
<br />
IRRINOVยฎ
can
be
automated
using
wireless

networks
and
semantic

The
considered

can
communicate
with
a
common
gateway,
which
is
connected
to
the
Internet.
The
IRRINOVยฎ
implementation
was
developed
in
[3].
This
work
presents
an
expert
system
for
maize
using
drools.
It
automates
the
irrigation

for
maize
based
on
sensor

we
use
the

<p>
Smart

a
large

of
mobile
devices
and

Location
information
may
be
integrated
with
a
logistics
or
fleet

system.
A
reusable
geolocation
module
is
needed
with
a
common
network
interface
to
include
in
these
various
applications.
For
outdoor
applications,
GPS
could
be
used,
but
indoors
other
geolocation
technologies
might
be
used,
such
as
WiFi
triangulation
or
vision-based
navigation
(SLAM).
Therefore
the
geolocation
information
should
be
technology-agnostic.
</p>
<p>
NOTE:
we
prefer
the
term
"geolocation",
even
indoors,
over
"localization"
to
avoid
confusion

Privacy
Considerations
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Location
is
generally
considered
private
information
when
it
is
used
with
a
device
that
may
be
associated
with
a
specific
person,
such
as
a
phone
or
vehicle,
as
it
can
be
used
to
track
that
person
and
infer
their
activities
or
who
they
associate
with
(if
multiple
people
are
being
tracked
at
once).
Therefore
APIs
to
access
geographic
location
in
sensitive
contexts
are
often
restricted,
and
access
is
allowed
only
after
confirming
permission
from
the
user.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Gaps
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
There
is
no
single
standardized
semantic
vocabulary
for
representing
location
data.
Location
data
can
be
point
data,
a
path,
an
area
or
a
volumetric
object.
Location
information
can
be
expressed
using
multiple
standards,
but
the
reader
of
location
data
in
a
TD
or
in
data
returned
by
an
IoT
device
must
be
able
to
unambiguously
describe
location
information.
</p>
<p>
There
are
both
dynamic
(data
returned
by
a
mobile
sensor)
and
static
(fixed
installation
location)
applications
for
geolocation
data.
For
dynamic
location
data,
some
recommended
vocabulary
to
annotate
data
schemas
would
be
useful.
For
static
location
data,
a
standard
format
for
metadata
to
be
included
in
a
TD
itself
would
be
useful.

In
this
use
case
a
network
full
of
IoT
devices
is
presented,
in
which
these
devices
are
registered
in
several
Middle-Nodes.
The
challenge
presented
in
this
scenario
is
to
be
able
to
discover
the
different
sensors,
by
issues
a
SPARQL
query,
and
without
having
prior
knowledge
of
where
those
devices
are
allocated.
Therefore,
the
discovery
SPARQL
query
must
start
from
a
specific
Middle-Node
and
reach
all
those
Middle-Nodes
that
are
relevant
to
answer
the
query.
This
scenario
requires
that
discovery
does
not
only
happen
locally
when
a
Middle-Node
receives
the
query
and
checks
if
some
Thing
Description
registered
is
suitable
to
answer
the
query.
Instead,
the
scenario
requires
also
that
the
Middle-Node
forwards
the
query
through
the
network
(topology
conformed
by
the
middle-nodes)
in
order
to
find
those
Middle-Nodes
that
actually
contain
relevant
Thing
Descriptions.
Notice
from
the
following
example
that
the
query
is
not
broadcasted
in
the
network
to
prevent
flooding,
instead
the
Middle-Nodes
follow
some
discovery
heuristic
to
know
where
the
query
should
be
forwarded.
Also,
notice
that
in
this
scenario
not
all
the
Middle-Nodes
have
the
IoT
devices
registered
directly
within,
they
are
Middle-Nodes
collectors,
such
as
Middle-Node
C,
I,
G,
and
D.

Description
</dt>
<dd>
A
campus
has
a
wide
range
of
IoT
devices
distributed
across
their
grounds.
These
IoT
devices
belong
to
very
different
domains
in
a
smart
city,
such
as,
energy,
buildings,
environment,
water,
wearable,
etc.
The
IoT
devices
are
distributed
across
the
campus
and
belong
to
different
infrastructures
or
even
to
individuals.
A
sample
topology
of
this
scenario
could
be
the
following:
<br />
<br />
<div class="resize">
<img src="images/smart-campus-topology.svg" alt="sample topology of a smart campus" height="1011" width= "1350" />
</div>
<br />
<br />
In
this
scenario,
energy-related
IoT
devices
monitor
the
energy
use
and
income
in
the
campus,
among
other
things.
From
these
measurements,
an
Energy
Management
System
may
predict
a
negative
peak
of
incoming
energy
that
would
entail
the
failure
of
the
whole
system.
In
this
case,
a
Service
or
a
User
needs
to
discover
all
those
IoT
devices
that
are
not
critical
for
the
normal
functioning
of
the
campus
(such
as
indoor
or
outdoor
illumination,
HVAC
systems,
or
water
heaters)
and
interact
with
them
in
order
to
save
energy,
by
switching
them
off
or
reducing
their
consumption.
Besides,
the
same
Service
or
User
will
look
for
those
IoT
devices
that
are
critical
for
the
well-functioning
of
the
campus
(such
as
magnetic
locks,
water
distribution
system,
or
fire/smoke
sensors)
and
ensure
that
they
are
up
and
running.
Additionally,
the
Service
or
the
User,
will
discover
relevant
people's
wearable
to
warn
them
about
the
situation.
<p>
Sample
flow:
</p>
A
service,
or
a
user,
sends
a
(SPARQL)
query
to
the
discovery
endpoint
of
a
known
Middle-Node
(which
can
be
wrapped
by
a
GUI).
The
Middle-Node
will
try
to
answer
the
query
first
checking
the
Thing
Descriptions
of
the
IoT
devices
registered
in
such
Middle-Node.
Then,
if
the
query
requires
further
discovery,
or
it
was
not
successfully
answered
the
Middle-Node
will
forward
the
query
to
its
*known*
Middle-Nodes.
Recursively,
the
Middle-Nodes
will
try
to
answer
the
query
and/or
forward
the
query
to
their
known
Middle-Nodes.
When
one
Middle-Node
is
able
to
answer
the
query
it
will
forward
back
to
the
former
Middle-Node
the
partial
query
answer.
Finally,
when
the
discovery
task
finishes,
the
former
Middle-Node
will
join
all
the
partial
query
answers
producing
an
unified
view
(which
could
be
synchronous
or
asynchronous).
<br />
<br />
For
instance,
assuming
Middle-Node
F
receives
a
query
that
asks
about
all
the
discoverable
Building
IoT
devices
in
the
campus.
First,
the
Middle-Node
F
will
try
to
answer
the
query
with
the
Thing
Descriptions
of
the
IoT
registered
within.
Since
Middle-Node
F
contains
some
Building
IoT
devices
a
partial
query
answer
is
achieved.
However,
since
they
query
asked
about
all
the
discoverable
Building
IoT
devices
Middle-Node
F
should
forward
the
query
to
its
other
known
Middle-Nodes,
i.e.,
Middle-Node
G.
This
process
will
be
repeated
by
the
Middle-Nodes
until
the
query
reaches
the
Middle-Nodes
H
and
B
which
are
the
ones
that
have
registered
Thing
Descriptions
about
IoT
buildings.
Therefore,
the
query
will
travel
through
the
topology
as
follows:
<br />
<br />
<div class="resize">
<img src="images/smart-campus-sample.svg" alt= "query goes through the topology for a smart campus" height="774" width="1827" />
</div>
<br />
<br />
Finally,
when
Middle
Nodes
B
and
H
compute
two
partial
query
answers,
those
answers
will
be
forwarded
back
to
Middle-Node
F
which
will
join
them
with
its
former
partial
query
answer
obtained
from
its
registered
Thing
Descriptions.
Finally,
a
global
query
answer
will
be
provided.

Nowadays,

to
understand
the
building

As
part
of
the
pre-renovation
activities,
the
renovation
companies
deploy
various
sensors
to
collect
relevant
data
over
a
period
of
time.
Such

become
part
of
a
wireless

(WSN)
and
expose
data
endpoint
with
the
help
of
one

Depending
on
the
protocols,
the
endpoints
require
different
interaction
flows
to
securely
access
the
current
and
historical
measurements.
The
renovation
applications
need
to

and
how
to

with
them
based
on
search
criteria

Motivation
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
When
operating
smart
buildings,
aggregating
and
managing
all
data
provided
by
heterogeneous
devices
in
these
buildings
still
require
a
lot
of
manual
effort.
Besides
the
hurdles
of
data
acquisition
that
relies
on
multiple
protocols,
the
acquired
data
generally
lacks
contextual
information
and
metadata
about
its
location
and
purpose.
Usually,
each
service
or
application
that
consumes
data
from
building
things
requires
information
about
its
content
and
its
context
like,
e.g.:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
which
thing
produces
the
data
(sensor,
meter,
actuator,
other
technical
component...)
in
a
building;
</li>
<li>
which
physical
quantity
or
process
is
represented
(temperature,
energy
supply,
monitoring,
actuation);
</li>
<li>
which
other
building
things
are
involved
(e.g.
sensor
hosted
by
a
duct
or
a
space).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Through
the
increased
use
of
model-based
data
exchange
over
the
whole
life
cycle
of
a
building,
often
referred
to
as
Building
Information
Modeling
(BIM)
(Sacks
et
al.,
2018),
a
curated
source
for
data
describing
the
building
itself
is
available
including,
amongst
others,
the
topology
of
the
building
structured
into
e.g.
sites,
stores
and
spaces.
</p>
<p>
Automatically
tracking
down
data
and
their
related
things
in
a
building
would
especially
ease
the
configuration
and
operation
of
Building
Automation
and
Control
Systems
(BACS)
and
Heating
Ventilation
and
Air-Conditioning
(HVAC)
services
during
commissioning,
operation,
maintenance
and
retrofitting.
To
tackle
these
challenges,
still,
building
experts
make
use
of
metadata
and
naming
conventions
which
are
manually
implemented
in
Building
Management
Systems
(BMS)
databases
to
annotate
data
and
things.
An
important
property
of
a
thing
is
its
location
within
the
topology
of
a
building
as
well
as
where
its
related
data
are
produced
or
used.
For
example,
this
applies
to
the
temperature
sensor
of
a
space,
the
temperature
setpoint
of
a
zone,
a
mixing
damper
flap
actuator
of
a
HVAC
component,
etc.
In
addition,
other
attributes
of
things
are
of
interest,
such
as
cost
or
specific
manufacturer
data.
One
difficulty
is
especially
the
lack
of
a
standardized
way
of
creating,
linking
and
sharing
this
information
in
an
automated
manner.
On
the
contrary,
manufacturers,
service
providers
and
users
introduce
their
own
metadata
for
their
own
purpose.
As
a
solution,
the
Web
of
Things
(WoT)
Thing
Description
(TD)
aims
at
providing
normalized
and
syntactic
interoperability
between
things.
</p>
<p>
To
support
this
effort,
this
use
case
is
motivated
by
the
need
to
enhance
semantic
interoperability
between
things
in
smart
buildings
and
to
provide
them
with
contextual
links
to
building
information.
This
building
information
is
usually
obtained
from
a
BIM
model.
The
use
case
builds
on
Web
of
Data
technologies
and
reuses
schemas
available
from
the
Linked
Building
Data
domain.
It
should
serve
as
a
use
case
template
for
many
applications
in
an
Internet
of
Building
Things
(IoBT).

<p>
The
goal
of
this
use
case
is
to
show
the
potential
to
automate
workflows
and
address
the
heterogeneity
of
data
as
observed
in
the
smart
building
domain.
The
examples
show
the
potential
benefits
of
combining
WoT
TD
with
contextual
data
obtained
from
BIM.
</p>
<p>
The
use
cases
is
based
on
the
<a href= "https://github.com/TechnicalBuildingSystems/OpenSmartHomeData">
Open
Smart

</a>,
which
introduces
a
BIM

combined
with
observations
made
by
typical
smart
home

We
extend
the
dataset
with

<p>
The
scenario
considered
is
related
to
the
replacement
of
a
temperature
sensor
in
a
BACS.
The
topological
information
localizing
the
things,
e.g.
the
<a href= "#TemperatureSensor">
temperature
sensor
</a>
can
be
used
to
automatically
commission
the
newly
replaced
sensor
and
link
it
to
existing
control
algorithms.
For
this
purpose,
the
identifiers
of
suitable
sensors
and
actuators
are
needed
and
can
be,
for
example,
queried
via
<a href= "https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">
SPARQL
</a>.
Here
the
query
uses
some

In
this
example
query,
the
REST
endpoint
has
been
defined
using
the
<a href="https://www.openapis.org/">
OpenAPI
specification
</a>
and
is
provided
by
a
RESTful
server.
A
data
binding
is
needed
between
the
server
and
the
underlying
backend
storage,
here
the
triple
store
that
contains
the
involved
ontologies
(osh,
bot,
ssn,
brick...).
The
data
binding
relies
on
similar
SPARQL
queries
as
the
one
shown
above.
As
a
result
the
endpoint
can
deliver
information
to
a
target
application
that
consumes
custom
JSON
rather
than
triples.
Similar
implmentation
could
be
achieved
using

Automated

<dd>
<p>
Another
related
use
case
in
smart
buildings,
which
would
greatly
benefit
from
harmonised
thing
descriptions
and
attached
location
information
is
related
to
the
detection
of
unexpected
behavior,
errors
and
faults.
An
example
for
such
a
detection
of
faults
is
the
rule-based
surveillance
of
sensor
values.
A
generic
rule
applicable
to
sensors
is
that
the
observation
values
stay
within
the
measurement
range
of
the
sensor.
Again,
in
the
case
of
maintenance
as
described
above
a
sensor
is
replaced.
</p>
<p>
Some
agent
configuring
fault
detection
rules
can
obtain
the
measurement
range
from
the
sensor's
TD
(see
above)
to
obtain
the
parameters
to
configure
the
mentioned
rule.
Again,
a
query
or
API
call
retrieving
this
information
(schema:minValue/
schema:maxValue)
can
be
used
to
update
the
upper
and
lower
bound
of
the
values
provided
by
the
<a href="#TemperatureSensor">
sensor
</a>.

Security
Considerations
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Security
in
smart
buildings
is
of
importance.
In
particular,
access
control
needs
to
be
properly
secured.
This
applies
also
for
data
access
which
can
be
secured
using
existing
security
schemes
(API
Keys,
OAuth2...).
Moreover,
from
certain
observations,
e.g.
electricity
consumption,
clues
can
be
indirectly
given
such
as
presence
in
a
home.
Hence,
security
needs
must
be
defined
and
properly
addressed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Privacy
Considerations
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Privacy
considerations
can
be
of
a
concern
if
observations
of
sensors
can
be
matched
to
individuals.
It
is
of
the
responsibility
of
building
owners,
managers
and
users
to
define
their
own
privacy
policies
for
their
data
and
share
necessary
consents
if
necessary.

</dd>
<dt>
Accessibility
Considerations
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Accessibility
is
a
major
concern
in
the
buildings
domain.
Efforts
exist
in
also
providing
accessibility
data
in
a

Internationalization

a
global
industry.
This
is
reflected
in
some

The
growing
adoption
of
energy
management
systems,
building
automation
and
management
systems
and
IoT
devices
is
producing
larger
volumes
and
varieties
of
data.
As
a
result,
data-driven
smart
building
applications
are
becoming
increasingly
common
and
practical
to
adopt.
Examples
of
these
applications
include:
</ins><ul><li><ins class="diff-new">

high-performance
"sequences

</ins></li></ul><ins class="diff-new">
There
is
still
significant
cost
in
deploying
these
applications
because
of
the
effort
required
to
customize
and
configure
their
operation
for
each
individual
building.
While
ontologies
exist
for
describing
sensors
and
the
data
they
produce
and
for
describing
the
spatial
topology
of
buildings,
the
applications
above
require
modeling
the
context

that
are
embedded
</ins><strong><ins class="diff-new">

including
HVAC

lighting
systems,
electrical

This
must
be
done
in
a

In
these
settings,
devices
are
usually
not
commercial
off-the-shelf
IoT
devices,
but
rather
"packaged
units"
and
other
"lower
level"
devices
that
perform
physical
tasks
on
behalf
of
a
larger
system:
pumps,
fans,
variable
frequency
drives,
variable
air
volume
boxes
and
chillers
are
all
examples.
Such
devices
are
connected
to
one
another
using
wires,
pipes,
ducts
and
other
mechanisms.
Sensors,
actuators
and
other
data
sources
and
sinks
are
associated
with
the
devices
in
these
subsystems.
Through
some
digital
control
system,
they
relay
telemetry
on
the
current
behavior,
status
and
performance
of
devices
and
properties
of
the
substances
and
media
touched
by
the
building
subsystem.
</ins></p><p><ins class="diff-new">
It
is
important
for
descriptions
of
these
systems
to
be
built
on
standardized,
well-known
names
for
equipment
and
other
devices
in
building
subsystems.
Reliance
on
generic
terminology
is
not
sufficient
to
distinguish
the
different
kinds
of
systems
and
different
kinds
of
equipment
in
a
broadly
consistent
and
interpretable
manner.
Research
and
practice
shows
that
a
common
terminology
must
be
established
in
order
to
reduce
the
costs
associated
with
developing
and
deploying
data-driven
applications
that
touch
the
internals
of
cyber-physical
systems.
</ins></p><p><ins class="diff-new">
To
support
this
use
case,
WoT
descriptions
should
describe
the
networked
devices
present
in
building
subsystems
and
their
data
capabilities.
These
capabilities
should
be
related
to
properties
of
the
substances
or
media
that
a
device
is
operating
on.
For
example,
a
smart
thermostat's
API
may
present
a
"mode"
as
a
read-only
property.
"Mode"
commonly
refers
to
what
the
thermostat
is
"calling
for",
e.g.
cooling,
heating,
fan;
this
is
commonly
captured
as
a
numerical
value.
The
mode
is
read
by
HVAC
equipment,
such
as
a
rooftop-unit,
which
then
enacts
the
desired
conditioning.
The
WoT
description
of
the
mode
property
should
permit
the
determination
of
what
properties
of
</ins><em><ins class="diff-new">
other
devices
and
entities
in
the
building
</ins></em><ins class="diff-new">
may
be
affected
by
the
value
of
the
mode
property.
In
this
example,
the
mode
property
representation
should
indicate
that
the
mode
property
indirectly
affects
the
temperature
of
air
in
the
rooms
that
are
connected
to
the
equipment
controlled
by
the
thermostat.

"Rogue
zones"
are
regions
of
the

drive

One
simple
way
to

is
to

<p>
A
company
owns
multiple
factories
which
contain
multiple
production
lines.
Examples
are
production
lines
and
environment
sensors.
These
devices
collect
data
from
multiple
sensors
and
transmit
this
information
to
the
cloud.
Sensor
data
is
stored
in
the
cloud,
can
be
visualized
and
analyzed
using
machine
learning
/
AI.
</p>
<p>
The
cloud
service
allows
to
manage
single
and
groups
of
devices.
Combining
the
data
streams
from
multiple
devices
allows
to
get
an
easy
overview
of
the
state
of
all
connected
devices
in
the
user's
realm.
</p>
<p>
In
many
cases
there
are
groups
of
devices
of
the
same
kind,
so
the
aggregation
of
data
across
devices
can
serve
to
identify
anomalies
or
to
predict
impending
outages.
</p>
<p>
The
cloud
service
allows
to
manage
single
and
groups
of
devices
and
can
help
to
identify
abnormal
conditions.
For
this
purpose
a
set
of
rules
can
be
defined
by
the
user,
which
raises
alerts
towards
the
user
or
triggers
actions
on
devices
based
on
these
rules.
</p>
<p>
This
enables
the
early
detection
of
pending
problems
and
reduces
the
risk
of
machine
outages,
quality
problems
or
threats
to
the
environment
or
life
of
humans.
It
increases
production
efficiency,
improves
production
logistics
(such
as
raw
material
delivery
and
production
output).

bottling
line
consists
of
a
filling
module
(switchable
between
2
fillers
and
4
fillers),
a
capping
module,
a
labeling
module,
and
a
transport
system.
The
production
line
is
provided
via
an
OPC
UA
endpoint
for
control
and
monitoring
purposes.

In
the
context
of
enhancing
productivity
and
sustainability,
the
goal
is
to
operate
the
bottling
line
in
such
a
way
that
production
is
further
increased
when
sufficient
or
surplus
renewable
energy
is
available.
The
backend
system
checks
periodically
a
Smart
Grid
endpoint
(via
HTTP)
how
the
current
power
production
is
and
how
much
renewable
energy
is
produced.
Based
on
the
bottling
line's
current
power
consumption,
which
is
measured
via
Modbus,
the
backend
system
decides
to
increase
productivity
when
surplus
renewable
energy
is
available.
In
doing
so,
the
backend
system
interacts
via
OPC
UA
to
release
the
4
fillers
of
the
filling
module
and
increases
the
speed
of
the
transport
system.
If
the
backend
system
detects
that
less
renewable
energy
is
being
produced,
it
will
initiate
standard
production
and
reduce
the
transport
speed
and
return
the
2
fillers
of
the
filling
module.

<dd>
<p>
Integrating
and
interconnecting
multiple
devices
into
the
common
retail
workflow
(i.e.,
transaction
log)
drastically
improves
retail
business
operations
at
multiple
levels.
It
brings
operational
visibility,including
consumer
behavior
and
environmental
information,
that
was
not
previously
possible
or
viable
in
a
meaningful
way.
</p>
<p>
It
drastically
speeds
up
the
process
of
root
cause
analysis
of
operational
issues
and
simplifies
the
work
of
retailers.

Description
</dt>
<dd>
Falling
costs
of
sensors,
communications,
and
handling
of
very
large
volumes
of
data
combined
with
cloud
computing
enable
retail
business
operations
with
increased
operational
efficiency,
better
customer
service,
and
even
increased
revenue
growth
and
return
on
investment.
Accurate
forecasts
allow
retailers
to
coordinate
demand-driven
outcomes
that
deliver
connected
customer
interactions.
They
drive
optimal
strategies
in
planning,
increasing
inventory
productivity
in
retail
supply
chains,
decreasing
operational
costs
and
driving
customer
satisfaction
from
engagement,
to
sale,
to
fulfilment.
Understanding
of
store
activity
juxtaposed
with
traditional
information
streams
can
boost
worker
and
consumer
safety,
comply
better
with
work
safety
regulations,
enhance
system
and
site
security,
and
improve
worker
efficiency
by
providing

Security
Considerations

<dd>
<ul>
<li>
In
retail,
replay
attacks
can
cause
monetary
loss,
customers
may
be
incorrectly
charged
or
over-charged.
</li>
<li>
To
avoid
replay
attacks,
"Things"
should
implement
a
sequence
number
for
each
message
and
digital
signature.
</li>
<li>
Servers
("Things"
or
"Cloud")
should
verify
the
signature
and
disallow
for
duplicated
messages.
</li>
<li>
For
"Things"
relying
on
electronic
payments,
"Things"
must
comply
with
PCI-DSS
requirements.
</li>
<li>
"Things"
must
never
store
credit
card
information.
</li>
<li>
Customer
satisfaction
and
trust
depends
on
availability,
so
attacks
such
as
Denial-of-Service
(DoS)
need
to
be
prevented
or
mitigated.
</li>
<li>
To
prevent
DoS,
implement
"Things"
with
early
DoS
detection.
</li>
<li>
Have
an
automated
DoS
system
that
will
notify
the
controlling
unit
of
the
problem.
</li>
<li>
Implement
IP
white
list,
that
could
be
part
of
the
DoS
early
detection
system.
</li>
<li>
Make
sure
your
network
perimeter
is
defended
with
up
to
date
firewall
software.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
Privacy
Considerations
</dt>
<dd>
As
a
general
rule,
personal
consumer
information
should
not
be
stored.
That
is
especially
true
in
the
retail
industry
where
a
security
breach
could
cause
financial,
reputation,
and
brand
damage.
If
personal
or
information
that
can
identify
a
consumer
is
to
be
stored,
it
should
be
to
conduct
business
and
with
the
explicit
acknowledgment
of
the
consumer.
WoT
vendors
and
integrators
should
always
have
a
privacy
policy
and
make
it
easily
available.
By
default,
devices
should
adopt
an
opt-out
policy.
That
means,
unless
the
consumer
explicitly
allowed
for
the
data
capture
and
storage,
avoid
doing
it.

<dd>
A
system
to
monitor
the
health
of
people
in
public
places
is
useful
to
control
the
spread
of
infectious
diseases.
In
particular,
we
would
like
to
identify
individuals
with
temperatures
outside
the
norm
(i.e.
running
a
fever)
and
then
take
appropriate
action.
Actions
can
include
sending
a
notification
or
actuating
a
security
device,
such
as
a
gate.
This
mechanism
should
be
non-invasive
and
non-contact
since
the
solution
should
not
itself
contribute
to
the
spread
of
infectious
diseases.
Data
may
also
be
aggregated
for
statistics
purposes,
for
example,
to
identify
the
number
of
people
in
an
area
with
elevated
temperatures.
This
has
additional
requirements
to
avoid
double-counting
individuals.

Description
</dt>
<dd>
A
thermal
camera
image
is
taken
of
a
group
of
people
and
an
AI
service
is
used
to
identify
faces
in
the
image.
The
temperature
of
each
person
is
then
estimated
from
the
registered
face;
for
greater
accuracy,
a
consistent
location
for
sampling
should
be
used,
such
as
the
forehead.
The
estimated
temperature
is
compared
to
high
(and
optionally,
low)
thresholds
and
a
notification
(or
other
action)
is
taken
if
the
temperature
is
outside
the
norm.
Additional
features
may
be
extracted
to
identify
unique
individuals.
</dd>
<dt>
Variants
</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
Enough
information
is
included
in
the
notification
that
the
specific
person
that
raised
the
alarm
can
be
identified.
For
example,
if
an
RGB
camera
is
also
registered
with
the
thermal
camera,
then
a
bounding
box
may
be
indicated
via
JSON
and
the
RGB
image
included;
or
the
bounding
box
could
be
actually
drawn
into
the
sent
image,
or
the
face
could
be
cropped
out.
This
is
useful
if,
for
example,
a
notification
needs
to
be
sent
to
health
or
security
workers
who
need
to
identify
the
person
in
a
crowd.
</li>
<li>
Instead
of
simply
a
notification,
an
action
may
be
taken,
such
as
closing
or
refusing
to
open
a
gate
at
the
entrance
to
a
building,
to
prevent
sick
employees
from
entering
the
building.
</li>
<li>
To
generate
statistics,
for
example
to
count
the
number
of
people
with
fevers,
then
unique
individuals
need
to
be
identified
to
avoid
counting
the
same
person
more
than
once.
</li>
<li>
The
same
sensors
might
be
used
to
determine
the
number
of
people
in
an
area
and
send
a
notification
if
crowded
conditions
are
detected,
in
order
to
support
social
distancing
behavior
(for
instance,
supporting
an
app
that
notifies
users
when
a
destination
is
crowded)
in
a
pandemic
situation.

Preventable
medical
errors
may
account
for
more
than
100,000
deaths
per
year
in
U.S.
alone.
These
errors
are
mainly
caused
by
failures
of
communication
such
as
a
chart
misread
or
the
wrong
data
passed
along
to
machines
or
staffs.
Part
of
the
problem
could
be
solved
if
the
machines
could
speak
to
one
another.
Manufacturers
have
little
incentive
to
make
their
proprietary
code
and
data
easily
to
accessible
and
process
able
by
their
competitorsโ
machines.
So
the
task
of
middleman
falls
to
the
hospital
staffs.
In
addition
to
saving
lives,
a
common
framework
could
result
in
collecting
and
recording
more
clinical
data
on
patients,
making
it
easier
to
deliver
precision
medicine.

<p>
Physiological
Closed-Loop
Control
(PCLC)
devices
are
a
group
of
emerging
technologies,
which
use
feedback
from
physiological
sensor(s)
to
autonomously
manipulate
physiological
variable(s)
through
delivery
of
therapies
conventionally
delivered
by
clinician(s).
</p>
<p>
Clinical
scenario
without
PCLC.
An
elderly
female
with
end-stage
renal
failure
was
given
a
standard
insulin
infusion
protocol
to
manage
their
blood
glucose,
but
no
glucose
was
provided.
Their
blood
glucose
dropped
to
33,
then
rebounded
to
over
200
after
glucose
was
given.
This
scenario
has
not
changed
for
decades.
</p>
<p>
The
desired
state
with
PCLC
implemented
in
an
ICU.
A
patient
is
receiving
an
IV
insulin
infusion
and
is
having
the
blood
glucose
continuously
monitored.
The
infusion
pump
rate
is
automatically
adjusted
according
to
the
real-time
blood
glucose
levels
being
measured,
to
maintain
blood
glucose
values
in
a
target
range.
If
the
patientโs
glucose
level
does
not
respond
appropriately
to
the
changes
in
insulin
administration,
the
clinical
staff
is
alerted.
</p>
<p>
Medical
devices
do
not
interact
with
each
other
autonomously
(monitors,
ventilator,
IV
pumps,
etc.)
Contextually
rich
data
is
difficult
to
acquire.
Technologies
and
standards
to
reduce
medical
errors
and
improve
efficiency
have
not
been
implemented
in
theater
or
at
home.
</p>
<p>
In
recent
years,
researchers
have
made
progress
developing
PCLC
devices
for
mechanical
ventilation,
anesthetic
delivery
applications,
and
so
on.
Despite
these
promises
and
potential
benefits,
there
has
been
limited
success
in
the
translation
of
PCLC
devices
from
<a href= "https://today.duke.edu/2014/07/benchbedside">
bench
to
bedside
</a>.
A
key
challenge
to
bringing
PCLC
devices
to
a
level
required
for
a
clinical
trials
in
humans
is
risk
management
to
ensure
device
reliability
and
safety.
</p>
<p>
The
United
States
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)
classifies
new
hazards
that
might
be
introduced
by
PCLC
devices
into
three
categories.
Besides
clinical
factors
(e.g.
sensor
validity
and
reliability,
inter-
and
intra-patient
physiological
variability)
and
usability/human
factors
(e.g.
loss
of
situational
awareness,
errors,
and
lapses
in
operation),
there
are
also
engineering
challenges
including
robustness,
availability,
and
integration
issues.

Security

<p>
Security

are
critical
not
only
because
laws
such
as
<ins class="diff-chg">[

</cite>
<ins class="diff-new">]
</ins>
mandate
it,
but
also
because
security
attacks
can
have
serious
safety
consequences
for
patients.
The
systems
need
to
support
automatic
verification
that
the
system
components
are
being
used
as
intended
in
the
clinical
context,
that
the
components
are
authentic

authorized
for
use
in
that
environment,
that
they
have
been
approved
by

that
they
meet
regulatory
safety
and

requirements.

compliant
medical
devices
never
interact
directly
each
other.
All
interaction
is
coordinated
and
controlled
via
the
applications.
</p>
<p>
While
transport-level
security
such
as
TLS
provides
reasonable
protection
against
external
attackers,
they
do
not
provide
mechanisms
for
granular
access
control
for
data
streams
happening
within
the
same
protected
link.
Transport-level
security
is
also
not
sufficiently
flexible
to
balance
between
security
and
performance.
Another
issue
with
widely
used
transport-level
security
solutions
is
the
lack
of
support
for

The
term
Smart
Grid
refers
to
the
communicative
networking
and
control
of
power
generators,
storage
facilities,
electrical
consumers,
and
grid
equipment
in
power
transmission
and
distribution
networks
for
electricity
supply.
This
enables
the
optimization
and
monitoring
of
the
interconnected

The
aim
is
to
secure
the
energy
supply
on
the
basis
of
efficient

</dt>
<dd>
While
electricity
grids
with
centralized
power
generation
have
dominated
up
to
now,
the
trend
is
moving
towards
decentralized
generation
plants,
both
for
generation
from
fossil
primary
energy
through
small
CHP
plants
and
for
generation
from
renewable
sources
such
as
photovoltaic
systems,
solar
thermal
power
plants,
wind
turbines
and
biogas
plants.
This
leads
to
a
much
more
complex
structure,
primarily
in
the
area
of
load
control,
voltage
maintenance
in
the
distribution
grid
and
maintenance
of
grid
stability.
In
contrast
to
medium
to
large
power
plants,
smaller,
decentralized
generation
plants
also
feed
directly
into
the
lower
voltage
levels
such
as
the
low-voltage
grid
or
the
medium-voltage
grid.
This
use
case

also

energy
storages

Virtual
Power
Plants
</dt>
<dd>
A
Virtual
Power
Plant
(VPP)
is
an
aggregation
of
Distributed
Energy
Resources
(DERs)
that
can
act
as
an
entity
on
energy
markets
or
as
an
ancillary
service
to
grid
operation.
The
individual
DERs
often
have
a
primary
use
on
their
own,
with
electric
generation/consumption
being
a
side-effect
resp.
secondary
use.
This
results
in
negotiations/collaborations
between
many
different
parties
e.g.
such
as
the
DER
owner,
the
VPP
operator,
the
grid
operator
and
others.

<dt>
Smart
Metering
</dt>
<dd>
For
consumers,
a
major
change
is
the
installation
of
smart
meters.
Their
core
tasks
are
remote
reading
and
the
possibility
to
realize
fluctuating
prices
within
a
day
at
short
notice.
All
electricity
meters
must
therefore
be
replaced
by
those
with
remote
data
transmission.

Multi-Stakeholder
Operation:
Multiple

of
operation
</li>
<li>
Device
Lifecycle
Management:
Since
the
VPP
is
a
dynamic
system
of
loosely
coupled
DERs,
the
appearance
and
disappearance
of
DERs
as
well
as
the
software
management
on
the
devices
itself
requires
a
means
to
orchestrate
the
lifecycle
of
individual

components.
</li>
<li>
Embedded
Runtime:
Especially
for
DERs
in
remote
locations,
maintaining
a
close
couple
control
loop
can
be
expensive
if
feasible
at
all.
Therefore,
it
is
desirable
to
be
able
to
offload
control
logic
to
the
DER
itself.
</li>
<li>
Ensemble
Discovery:
In
order
to
dynamically
find
matching
DERs
needed
for
the
operational
goal
of
a
VPP,
a
registry
with
different
options
of
DER
discovery
is
needed.
</li>
<li>
Content-Negotiation:
The

stakeholders
have
to
interact
and
therefore
need
a
common
data
format.
</li>
<li>
Resource
Description:
The
DER
has
to
describe
itself
to
enable
discovery
of
single
DERs

ensembles,
also
the
operational

needs
to
be

the

As
there

a

with
many
devices
that
probably
have
a
rate-limited
connection
connecting
to
one
single
command
center,
a
bidirectional
communication
mechanism
is
needed
rather
than
polling
for
the
reverse
direction
</li>
<li>
Object
Memory:
As
multiple
and
interchangeable
stakeholders
are
involved
in
the
application,
a
backlog

is
beneficial
for
scrollkeeping

Privacy:
As
fine-grained
metering
information
provides
sensitive
data

the
system
should
show
a
high
degree
of
privacy
</li>
<li>
Trust:
Since
the
data
exchange
between
the
virtual
power
plant
and
the
distributed
energy
resource
leads
to
a
physical
action
that
invokes
high
currents
and
monetary
flows,
the
integrity
of
both
parties
and
the
exchange's
data
is
crucial
</li>
<li>
Layered
L7
Communication:
Since
multiple
different
links
are
used
for
monitoring
and
control,
integration
requires
a
clear
and
consistent
separation
of
information
from
the
used

are
stored
on
the
mobile
Device
(or
in
the
cloud),
and
can
be
transferred
across
different
car
models
handling
a
specific
functionality
(e.g.
all
cars
with
touchscreens
should
be
able
to
adapt
to
a
"high
contrast"
preference).
The
car
can
make
itself
available
as
a
complex
modality
component
that
wraps
around
all
functionality
and
supported
modalities,
or
as
a
collection
of
modality
components
such
as
touchscreen,
speech
recognition
system,
or
audio
player.
In
the
latter
case,
certain
user
preferences
may
be
shared
with
other
environments.
For
example,
a
user
may
opt
to
select
the
"high
contrast"
scheme
at
night
on
all
of
their
displays,
in
the
car
or
at
home.
A
car
that
provides
a
set
of
modalities
can
be
also
adapted
by
the
mobile
device
to
compose
an
interface
for
its
functionality,
for
example
to
manage
playback
of
music
tracks
through
the
car's
voice
control
system.
Sensor
data
provided
by
the
phone
can
be
mixed
with
data
recorded
by
the
car's
own
sensors
to
profile
user
behavior
which
can
be
used
as
context
in
multimodal

the

A

That
TD
describes

generated
in
software
from
inputs
that
may
or
may
not
be
similar

a

the

will

the

that
an

would
normally
provide.

Protocol
abstraction:
Typically,
devices
use
a
variety
of
protocols
and
methods
to
connect
to
the
IoT
network.
From
a
users
perspective
this
complexity
should
not
affect
other
business
applications
such
as
an
enterprise
resource
planning
(ERP)
application.
</p>
<p>
Business
rules:
The
user
can
specify
the
normal
operating
range
of
a
property
in
a
semantic
model.
Business
rules
can
be
declaratively
defined
and
actions
can
be
automatically
invoked
in
the
edge
or
on
the
device.
</p>
<p>
Example:
In
a
fleet
of
connected
vehicles,
the
user
monitors
a
collection
of
operating
parameters,
such
as
fuel
level,
location,
speed
and
others.
The
semantics-based
virtual
twin
model
enables
the
user
to
decide
whether
the
operating
parameters
are
in
normal
range.
In
out
of
range
conditions
the
user
can
take
appropriate
actions.

<dt>
Predictive
Twin
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
In
a
predictive
twin,
the
digital
twin
implementation
builds
an
analytical
or
statistical
model
for
prediction
by
using
a
machine-learning
technique.
It
need
not
involve
the
original
designers
of
the
machine.
It
is
different
from
the
physics-based
models
that
are
static,
complex,
do
not
adapt
to
a
constantly
changing
environment,
and
can
be
created
only
by
the
original
designers
of
the
machine.
</p>
<p>
A
data
analyst
can
easily
create
a
model
based
on
external
observation
of
a
machine
and
can
develop
multiple
models
based
on
the
userโs
needs.
The
model
considers
the
entire
business
scenario
and
generates
contextual
data
for
analysis
and
prediction.
</p>
<p>
When
the
model
detects
a
future
problem
or
a
future
state
of
a
machine,
the
user
can
prevent
or
prepare
for
them.
The
user
can
use
the
predictive
twin
model
to
determine
trends
and
patterns
from
the
contextual
machine
data.
The
model
helps
to
address
business
problems.

Twin
Projections
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
In
twin
projections,
the
predictions
and
the
insights
integrate
with
back-end
business
applications,
making
IoT
an
integral
part
of
business
processes.
When
projections
are
integrated
with
a
business
process,
they
can
trigger
a
remedial
business
workflow.
</p>
<p>
Prediction
data
offers
insights
into
the
operations
of
machines.
Projecting
these
insights
into

infrastructure
enables

to
interact
with
the
IoT
system
and
transform
into
intelligent

One
of
the
main
indicators
concerning
the
usability
of
a
system
is
the
corresponding
level
of
accessibility
provided
by
it.
The
opportunity
for
all
the
users
to
receive
and
to
deliver
all
kinds
of
information,
regardless
of
the
information
format
or
the
type
of
user
profile,
state
or
impairment
is
a
recurrent
need
in
web
applications.
One
of
the
means
to
achieve
accessibility
is
the
design
of
a
more
synergic
interaction
based
on
the
discovery
of
multimodal
Modality
Components.
Synergy
is
two
or
more
entities
functioning
together
to
produce
a
result
that
is
not
obtainable
independently.
It
means
"working
together".
For
example,
how
to
avoid
disruptive
interactions
in
nomadic
systems
(always
affected
by
the
changing
context)
is
an
important
issue.
In
these
applications,
user
interaction
is
difficult,
distracted
and
less
precise.
Discovery
and
use
of
alternative
input
and
output
devices
can
increase
synergic
interaction
offering
new
possibilities
more
adapted
to
the
current
context.
Such
a
system
can
also
enhance
the
fusion
process
for
target
groups
of
users
experiencing
permanent
or
temporary
learning
difficulties

Many
of
today's
home
IoT-enabled
devices
can
provide
similar
functionality
(e.g.
audio/video
playback),
differing
only
in
certain
aspects
of
the
user
interface.
This
use
case
would
allow
continuous
interaction
with
a
specific
application
as
the
user
moves
from
room
to
room,
with
the
user
interface
switched
automatically
to
the
set
of
devices
available
in
the
user's
present
location.
</p>
<p>
On
the
other
hand,
some
devices
can
have
specific
capabilities
and
user
interfaces
that
can
be
used
to
add
information
to
a
larger
context
that
can
be
reused
by
other
applications
and
devices.
This
drives
the
need
to
spread
an
application
across
different
devices
to
achieve
a
more
user-adapted
and
meaningful
interaction
according
to
the
context
of
use.
Both
aspects
provide
arguments
for
exploring
use
cases
where
applications
use
distributed
multimodal

A
home
entertainment
system
is
adapted
by
a
mobile
device
as
a
set
of
user
interface
components.
In
addition
to
media
rendering
and
playback,
these
Devices
also
act
as
input
or
output
modalities
for
an
application,
for
example
an
application
running
on
a
smartphone.
The
native
user
interface
on
the
application
does
not
have
to
be
manipulated
directly
at
all.
A
wall-mounted
touch-sensitive
TV
could
be
used
to
navigate
applications,
and
a
wide-range
microphone
can
handle
speech
input.
Spatial
(Kinect-style)
gestures
may
also
be
used
to
control
application
behavior.

OAuth
2.0
is
an
authorization
protocol
widely
known
for
its
usage
across
several
web
services.
It
enables
third-party
applications
to
obtain
limited
access
to
HTTP
services
on
behalf
of
the
resource
owner
or
of
itself.
The
protocol
defines
the
following
actors:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Client:
an
application
that
wants
to
use
a
resource
owned
by
the
resource
owner.
</li>
<li>
Authorization
Server:
An
intermediary
that
authorizes
the
client
for
a
particular
<code>
scope
</code>.
</li>
<li>
Resource:
a
web
resource
</li>
<li>
Resource
Server:
the
server
where
the
resource
is
stored
</li>
<li>
Resource
Owner:
the
owner
of
a
particular
web
resource.
If
it
is
a
human
is
usually
referred
to
as
an
end-user.
More
specifically
from
the
RFC:
<ul>
<li>
An
entity
capable
of
granting
access
to
a
protected
resource.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These
actors
can
be
mapped
to
WoT
entities:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Client
is
a
WoT
Consumer
</li>
<li>
Authorization
Server
is
a
third-party
service
</li>
<li>
Resource
is
an
interaction
affordance
</li>
<li>
Resource
Server
is
a

or

</li>
<li>
Resource
Owner
might
be
different
in
each
use
case.
A
Thing
Description
may
also
combine
resources
from
different
owners
or
web
server.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
TO
DO:
Check
the
OAuth
2.0
spec
to
determine
exactly
how
Resource
Owner
is
defined.
Is
it
the
actual
owner
of
the
resource
(e.g.
running
the
web
server)
or
simply
someone
with
the
rights
to
access
that
resource?
</p>
<p>
The
OAuth
2.0
protocol
specifies
an
authorization
layer
that
separates
the
client
from
the
resource
owner.
The
basic
steps
of
this
protocol
are
summarized
in
the
following
diagram:
</p>
<pre aria-busy="false"><code class=

+--------+

</code>
</pre>
<p>
Steps
A
and
B
defines
what
is
known
as
authorization
grant
type
or
flow.
What
is
important
to
realize
here
is
that
not
all
of
these
interactions
are
meant
to
take
place
over
a
network
protocol.
In
some
cases,
interaction
with
with
a
human
through
a
user
interface
may
be
intended.
OAuth2.0
defines
4
basic
flows
plus
an
extension
mechanism.
The
most
common
of
which
are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>
code
</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>
implicit
</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>
password
</code>
(of
resource
owner)
</li>
<li>
<code>
client
</code>
(credentials
of
the
client)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In
addition,
a
particular
extension
which
is
of
interest
to
IoT
is
the
<code>
device
</code>
flow.
Further
information
about
the
OAuth
2.0
protocol
can
be
found
in
<a href= "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1">
IETF
RFC6749
</a>.
In
addition
to
the
flows,
OAuth
2.0
also
supports
scopes.
Scopes
are
identifiers
which
can
be
attached
to
tokens.
These
can
be
used
to
limit
authorizations
to
particular
roles
or
actions
in
an
API.
Each
token
carries
a
set
of
scopes
and
these
can
be
checked
when
an
interaction
is
attempted
and
access
can
be
denied
if
the
token
does
not
include
a
scope
required
by
the
interaction.
This
document
describes
relevant
use
cases
for
each
of
the
OAuth
2.0
authorization
flows.

<dt>
Expected
Devices
</dt>
<dd>
To
support
OAuth
2.0,
all
devices
must
have
the
capability
of:
<ul>
<li>
Both
the
producer
and
consumer
must
be
able
to
create
and
participate
in
a
TLS
connection.
</li>
<li>
The
producer
must
be
able
to
verify
an
access
(bearer)
token
(i.e.
have
sufficient
computational
power/connectivity).
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
Comment:
<ul>
<li>
Investigate
whether
DTLS
can
be
used.
Certainly
the
connection
needs
to
be
encrypted;
this
is
required
in
the
OAuth
2.0
specification.
</li>
<li>
Investigate
whether
protocols
other
than
HTTP
can
be
used,
e.g.
CoAP.
<ul>
<li>
found
an
interesting
IETF
draft
RFC
about
CoAP
support(encrypted
using
various
mechanisms
like
DTLS
or
CBOR
Object

</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
Expected
Data
</dt>
<dd>
Depending
on
the
OAuth
2.0
flow
specified,
various
URLs
and
elements
need
to
be
specified,
for
example,
the
location
of
an
authorization
token
server.
OAuth
2.0
is
also
based
on
bearer
tokens
and
so
needs
to
include
the
same
data
as
those,
for
example,
expected
encryption
suite.
Finally,
OAuth
2.0
supports
scopes
so
these
need
to
be
defined
in
the
security
scheme
and
specified
in
the
form.

a
redirection-based
flow,
the
client
must
be
capable
of
interacting
with
the
resource
owner's
user-agent
(typically
a
web
browser)
and
capable
of
receiving
incoming
requests
(via
redirection)
from
the
authorization
server.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This
implies
that
the
code
flow
can
be
only
used
when
the
resource
owner
interacts
directly
with
the
WoT
consumer
at
least
once.
Typical
scenarios
are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In
a
home
automation
context,
a
device
owner
uses
a
third
party
software
to
interact
with/orchestrate
one
or
more
devices
</li>
<li>
Similarly,
in
a
smart
farm,
the
device
owner
might
delegate
its
authorization
to
third
party
services.
</li>
<li>
In
a
smart
home
scenario,
Thing
Description
Directories
might
be
deployed
using
this
authorization
mechanism.
In
particular,
the
list
of
the
registered
TDs
might
require
an
explicit
read
authorization
request
to
the
device
owner
(i.e.
an
human
who
has
bought
the
device
and
installed
it).
</li>
<li>...
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The
following
diagram
shows
the
steps
of
the
protocol
adapted
to
WoT
idioms
and
entities.
In
this
scenario,
the
WoT

has
read
the

of
a
Remote

and
want
to

one
of

</p>
<p>
The
device
flow
(IETF
<a href= "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">
RFC
8628
</a>
)
is
a
variant
of
the
code
flow
for
browserless
and
input-constrained
devices.
Similarly,
to
its
<i>
parent
</i>
flow,
it
requires
a
close
interaction
between
the
resource
owner
and
the
WoT
consumer.
Therefore,
the
use
cases
for
this
flow
are
the
same
as
the
code
authorization
grant
but
restricted
to
all
devices
that
do
not
have
a
rich
means
to
interact
with
the
resource
owner.
However,
differently
from
<code>
code
</code>,
RFC
8628
states
explicitly
that
one
of
the
actors
of
the
protocol
is
an
<b>
end-user
</b>
interacting
with
a
<b>
browser
</b>
(even
if
<a href= "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628#section-6.2">
section-6.2
</a>
briefly
describes
an
authentication
using
a
companion
app

Notable
mentions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the
protocol
is
heavily
end-user
oriented.
In
fact,
the
RFC
states
the
following
<ul>
<li>
Due
to
the
polling
nature
of
this
protocol
(as
specified
in
Section
3.4),
care
is
needed
to
avoid
overloading
the
capacity
of
the
token
endpoint.
To
avoid
unneeded
requests
on
the
token
endpoint,
the
client
<del class="diff-old">SHOULD
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">should
</ins>
only
commence
a
device
authorization
request
when
<b>
prompted
by
the
user
and
not
automatically
</b>,
such
as
when
the
app
starts
or
when
the
previous
authorization
session
expires
or
failAs.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
TLS
is
required
both
between
WoT
Consumer/Authorization
Server
and
between

</ul>
<p>
<strong>
client
credential
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The
Client
Credentials
grant
type
is
used
by
clients
to
obtain
an
access
token
outside
of
the
context
of
an
end-user.
From
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4">
RFC6749
</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The
client
can
request
an
access
token
using
only
its
client
credentials
(or
other
supported
means
of
authentication)
when
the
client
is
requesting
access
to
the
protected
resources
under
its
control,
or
<b>
those
of
another
resource
owner
that
has
been
previously
arranged
with
the
authorization
server
</b>
(the
method
of
which
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
specification).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Therefore
the
client
credential
grant
can
be
used:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When
the
resource
owner
is
a
public
authority.
For
example,
in
a
smart
city
context,
the
authority
provides
a
web
service
where
to
register
an
application
id.
</li>
<li>
Companion
application
</li>
<li>
Industrial
IoT.
Consider
a
smart
factory
where
the
devices
or
services
are
provisioned
with
client
credentials.
</li>
<li>...
</li>
</ul>

The
Client
Credentials
flow
is
illustrated
in
the
following
diagram.

how
the
Resource
Owner
is
not
present.

Comment:
Usually
client
credentials
are
distributed
using
an
external
service
which
is
used
by
humans
to
register
a
particular
application.
For
example,
the
<code>
npm
</code>
cli
has
a
companion
dashboard
where
a
developer
requests
the
generation
of
a
token
that
is
then
passed
to
the
cli.
The
token
is
used
to
verify
the
publishing
process
of
<code>
npm
</code>
packages
in
the
registry.
Further
examples
are
Docker
cli
and
OpenId
Connect
Client
Credentials.

The
RFC
above
suggests
using
<code>
code

flow
with
Proof
Key

instead.
</p>
<p>
The
implicit
flow
was
designed
for
public
clients
typically
implemented
inside
a
browser
(i.e.
javascript
clients).
As
the
<code>
code
</code>
is
a
redirection-based
flow
and
it
requires
direct
interaction
with
the
resource's
owner
user-agent.
However,
it
requires
one
less
step
to
obtain
a
token
as
it
is
returned
directly
in
the
authentication
request
(see
the
diagram
below).
</p>
<p>
Considering
the
WoT
context
this
flow
is
not
particularly
different
from
<code>
code
</code>
grant
and
it
can
be
used
in
the
same
scenarios.
</p>
<p>
Comment:
even
if
the
<code>
implicit

flow
is
deprecated
existing
services
may
still
using
it.

can
be
guided
by
a
virtual

through
a
physical
area
of

associated
with
features
of
interest
(which
may
or
may
not
be
at
the
same
physical
location
as
the
sensor
generating
the
data).
An
annotated
map
may
provide
additional
geospatial
guidance,
including
identification
of
landmarks,
locations
of
devices.
The
system
may
also
guide
the

The
user
can
travel
around
a
real
space
with
guidance
from
virtually
defined
geospatial
data
projected
on
a
head-mounted
wearable
display
synchronized
with
the
view
of
the
physical
environment.
</li>
<li>
The
wearable
display
can
generate
position
and
orientation
(geopose)
data
so
that
the
user's
movement
will
be
traced
through
the
physical
environment
and
can
synchronized
with
virtual
features.
</li>
<li>
The
user
can
control
the
video
images
provided
by
the
system,
based
sensors
attached
the
display
system
or
other
means
of
control
(gestures,
voice
input,
etc.)
</li>
<li>
The
technology
should
include
synchronization
of
playback
of
stored
video
media
and
related
sensors,
displays,
and
devices
as
well
as
the
display
of
geolocation
information
from
the
virtual
map.
</li>
<li>
Discovery
of
sensors
should
take
into
account
the
position
and
field
of
view
of
the
user
so
that
data
can
be
retrieved
only
for
the
relevant
features
of
interest.
</li>
<li>
Discovery
may
additionally
want
to
consider
the
motion
(e.g.
velocity)
of
the
user
to
that
data
soon
to
come
into
view
can
be
prefetched.
</li>
<li>
Metadata
for
sensors
needs
to
distinguish
between
the
location
of
the
device
itself
and
the
feature
of
interest
it
is
measuring.
For
example,
a
camera
might
monitor
traffic
on
a
highway.
The
feature
of
interest
is
the
location
on
the
highway
being
monitored,
while
the
location
of
the
camera
might
be
quite
far
away
(e.g.
mounted
on
top
of
a
building).

<ul>
<li>
Two
synchronized
displays
(for
example,
a
phone
and
a
headset)
can
offer
greater
insight
and
provide
clearer
guidance
to
the
user
by
showing
different
views
of
the
same
location,
e.g.
a
top-view
map
on
the
phone.
</li>
<li>
A
VR
(virtual-only)
implementation
may
also
be
used,
with
a
rendered
scene
replacing
the
real
scene.
This
may
be
applicable
to
contexts
such
as
a
Smart
City
dashboard
where
sensor
information
from
data
needs
to
be
viewed
in
context
without
having
to
actually
visit
the
site.
</li>
<li>
The
head-mounted
semi-transparent
display
might
be
replaced
in
some
contexts
with
a
handheld
display
e.g.
a
phone
or
tablet.
To
be
useful
for
AR
however,
such
a
device
needs
a
back
camera
to
simulate
transparency
and
capture
images
of
the
real
environment
(optional
for
VR),
and
a
way
to
determine
its
geolocation
and
orientation
(geopose)
relative
to
the
environment.
</li>
<li>
The
head-mounted
display
may
use
a
camera
rather
than
being
physically
transparent.
</li>
<li>
A
microphone
may
be
added
for
voice
input,
including
voice
commands.
This
avoid
having
to
clutter
the
view
with
controls.
</li>
<li>
A
3D
camera
(e.g.
LIDAR)
may
be
used
to
capture
a
view
of
the
environment,
which
can
be
helpful
to
establish
geopose
and
align
annotations
with
real
features
of
the
environment.
</li>
<li>
A
virtual
guide
for
a
particular
geographic
location,
e.g.
a
historical
site,
which
visualises
past
events
and
buildings
in
AR,
or
allows
remote
users
to
explore
in
VR.
</li>
<li>
A
medical
tool
which
allows
a
patient
to
describe
their
symptoms
using
AR,
e.g.
identify
a
painful
area
on
their
own
body,
which
is
also
modelled
as
a
'map'
to
show
internal
features
and
display
a
treatment
guide,
including
any
WoT
medical
devices.
</li>
<li>
A
virtual
controller
for
a
city
engineer
to
visualize
utilities,
e.g.
electrical
cables
or
water
pipes,
and
control
them.
For
example,
a
maintenance
engineer
could
switch
off
an
individual
street
lamp
in
order
to
replace
the
bulb
using
an
AR
menu
displayed
on
that
WoT-enabled
lamppost.
</li>
<li>
These
mechanisms
can
also
be
used
for
video
overlay
in
general.
The
technologies
are
related
to
the
recording,
playing,
and
distribution
of
video
content
when
the
data
is
stored.
Playback
of
stored
data
and
movements
would
be
useful
for
simulation
and
debugging.

Security
Considerations
</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
If
an
AR
systems
is
compromised
it
could
be
used
to
guide
a
user
into
a
dangerous
situation
while
hiding
that
fact
from
them,
e.g.
encouraging
them
to
step
over
a
drop.
</li>
<li>
For
the
above
reason
the
system
should
"fail
gracefully"
if
there
is
any
sign
its
integrity
is
compromised,
and
should
implement
mechanisms
(e.g.
signing)
to
detect
tampering.
Standards
should
be
similar
to
other
systems
than
can
cause
physical
harm,
e.g.
automobiles.
</li>
<li>
For
a
"simulated"
transparent
head-mounted
display
using
a
camera,
the
system
should
have
a
fail-safe
supporting
an
unfiltered
view,
which
should
be
automatic
even
if
the
processor
crashes.
</li>
<li>
For
all
systems
the
user
should
have
a
simple
way
(e.g.
a
single
button
push)
of
viewing
"baseline
reality".
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
Privacy
Considerations
</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
Systems
that
handle
or
display
private
data,
e.g.
medical
applications,
should
respect
the
relevant
regulations.
</li>
<li>
Private
data
should
not
be
retained
by
the
device
or
used
for
purposes
other
than
which
it
was
provided.
This
includes
the
location
of
personal
devices.
To
display
information
from
another's
personal
device,
permission
needs
to
be
explicitly
granted
by
that
person
and
this
permission
should
be
time

possibly
space-limited.

Geospatially

discovery
mechanisms

</li>
<li>
Geospatial
filters
for
discovery
that
include
a
pyramid-shaped
region
representing
the
field

of
the

Note:
a
basic
cylindrical,
spherical,
or
rectangular
filter
region
can
be
used
instead
and
then
the
irrelevant

filtered
out,
but
this

</li>
<li>
Geospatial

Note
that
mobile
devices
may
update
their
position
more
rapidly
than
a
discovery
service
may
be
able
to
support.
In
this
case
the
discovery
service
needs
to
take
the
velocity

last
known
position
of
the

source
into
account
and
compute
a

Motivation
</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
IoT
devices
are
often
designed
to
be
inexpensive
(so
they
can
be
used
at
scale),
small
(for
ease
of
installation)
and
are
often
power-limited,
for
example
needing
to
run
off
a
battery.
For
all
these
reasons,
they
usually
have
severely
limited
on-board
computational
capabilities.
</li>
<li>
For
applications
that
require
significant
computation
and/or
memory,
for
example
computer
vision,
machine
learning,
or
autonomous
navigation,
offloading
work
to
another
computer
on
the
network
may
be
advantageous.
</li>
<li>
Offloading
to
the
cloud
typically
involves
relatively
long
latencies
and
may
also
have
privacy
implications.
Edge
computing
implies
offloading
to
a
more
"local"
compute
node
with
lower
latency
and
optionally
under
more
direct
control
of
the
user
(improving
privacy).
This
can
be
important
for
control
applications
(e.g.
in
robotics),
computer
graphics
(e.g.
gaming)
and
for
applications
processing
imagery
(e.g.
facial
recognition).
</li>
<li>
An
edge
computer
is
also
a
convenient
place
to
run
persistent
computations
such
as
IoT
orchestration
rules
that
need
to
be
"always
on".
Such
an
IoT
orchestration
system,
in
addition
to
needing
to
read
from
sensors
and
send
commands
to
actuators
over
the
network,
may
also
invoke
computationally-intensive
services
(e.g.
image
recognition).
An
example
would
be
a
security
system
that
when
a
motion
sensor
is
tripped,
runs
a
person
detection
computation,
and
if
a
person
is
detected
when
and
where
they
should
not
be,
sounds
an
alarm.
The
motion
sensor
and
alarm
can
be
IoT
devices
while
the
person
detection
is
a
computationally-intensive
service.

Description
</dt>
<dd>
The
WoT
architecture
can
provide
an
interesting
approach
to
edge
computing:
<ul>
<li>
An
IoT
orchestration
running
in
an
edge
computer
can
consume
WoT
Thing
Descriptions
in
order
to
determine
how
to
connect
to
IoT
devices.
</li>
<li>
Fixed
services
(e.g.
person
detection)
and
generic
compute
nodes
(a
service
that
would
allow
an
arbitrary
computation
to
be
loaded
onto
it)
can
also
advertise
themselves
using
Thing
Descriptions,
allowing
an
IoT
orchestrator
to
interface
to
devices
and
services
in
a
uniform
way.
This
also
facilitates
support
for
"virtual
devices",
e.g.
using
computer
vision,
audio
recognition,
or
other
forms
of
analytics
in
place
of
a
physical
sensor.
</li>
<li>
WoT
discovery
can
be
used
to
find
appropriate
compute
services
for
IoT
devices
to
offload
computationally
demanding
tasks
to,
assuming
those
services
describe
themselves
with
TDs
and
advertise
their
availability
via
WoT
discovery
mechanisms.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
Variants
</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
An
edge
computer
can
provide
facilities
either
for
general-purpose
computation
(e.g.
loading
and
running
a
container
image,
script,
etc.)
or
special-purpose
fixed
computations
(e.g.
object
detection
and
tracking,
person
detection,
etc.).
General-purpose
computation
is
more
powerful
but
also
is
more
difficult
to
make
fully
secure.
</li>
<li>
An
edge
computation
can
be
stateless
(function
as
a
service,
FaaS)
or
stateful.
It
is
easier
to
migrate
stateless
computations
transparently
to
new
compute
hardware
but
state
then
needs
to
be
provided
by
a
separate
service,
e.g.
a
database,
and
it
is
harder
to
program.
</li>
<li>
Edge
computers
may
provide
just
IoT
orchestration
without
significant
computational
ability,
just
compute
offload,
or
both.
Many
more
use
cases
can
be
unlocked
by
providing
both.
</li>
<li>
Persistent
computation
can
be
provided
in
various
ways.
Rather
than
actually
running
continuously,
an
edge
computation
might
be
event-driven,
for
example.
</li>
<li>
Under
discussion
are
various
ways
to
integrate
edge
computation
with
the
web
execution
environment,
for
example
by
extending
web
and
service
workers.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
Security
Considerations
</dt>
<dd>
Edge
compute
services
supporting
the
specification
of
generic
computation
has
many
security
challenges.
In
addition
to
the
challenges
common
to
cloud
computing,
e.g.
protecting
"tenants"
from
seeing
each
other's
activity,
additional
challenges
arise
if
the
edge
computer
is
offering
computation
as
an
ad-hoc
service.
For
example,
there
needs
to
be
a
way
to
project
the
edge
computer
from
denial-of-service
attacks.
An
edge
computer
may
also
need
to
be
protected
from
physical
attacks.
There
is
also
the
possibility
that
an
edge
computer
might
be
physically
compromised
so
approaches
such
as
isolated
containers
(protecting
the
contents
from
the
edge
computer's
hypervisor),
and/or
validated
boot,
might
be
necessary
in
some
circumstances.
</dd>
<dt>
Privacy
Considerations
</dt>
<dd>
Edge
computers
can
theoretically
improve
privacy
since
sensitive
data
can
be
processed
"locally"
without
having
to
be
transmitted
to
a
remote
site.
This
however
is
tempered
by
edge
computer's
greater
vulnerability
to
physical
attacks.
To
avoid
offloading
work
to
a
malicious
edge
computer,
some
means
of
evaluating
the
trustworthiness
of
edge
computers
is
needed.

The
use
cases
help
to
identify
basic
components
such
as
devices
and
applications,
that
access
and
control
those
devices,
proxies
(i.e.,
gateways
and
edge
devices)
that
are
located
between
devices.
An
additional
component
useful
in
some
use
cases
is
the
directory,
which
assists
with
discovery.
</p>
<p>
Those
components
are
connected
to
the
internet
or
field
networks
in
offices,
factories
or
other
facilities.
Note
that
all
components
involved
may
be
connected
to
a
single
network
in
some
cases,
however,
in
general
components
can
be
deployed
across

<p>
Access
to
devices
is
made
using
a
description
of
their
functions
and
interfaces.
This
description
is
called
<em>
Thing
Description
(TD)
</em>.
A
<em>
Thing
Description
</em>
includes
a
general
metadata
about
the
device,
information
models
representing
functions,
transport
protocol
description
for
operating
on
information
models,
and
security
information.
</p>
<p>
General
metadata
contains
device
identifiers
(URI),
device
information
such
as
serial
number,
production
date,
location
and
other
human
readable
information.
</p>
<p>
Information
models
defines
device
attributes,
and
represent
deviceโs
internal
settings,
control
functionality
and
notification
functionality.
Devices
that
have
the
same
functionality
have
the
same
information
model
regardless
of
the
transport
protocols
used.
</p>
<p>
Because
many
systems
based
on
Web
of
Things
architecture
are
crossing
system
Domains,
vocabularies
and
meta
data
(e.g.
ontologies)
used
in
information
models
should
be
commonly
understood
by
involved
parties.
In
addition
to
REST
transports,
PubSub
transports
are
also
supported.
</p>
<p>
Security
information
includes
descriptions
about
authentication,
authorization
and
secure
communications.
Devices
are
required
to
put
TDs
either
inside
them
or
at
locations
external
to
the
devices,
and
to
make
TDs
accessible
so
that
other
components
can
find
and

them.

Digital

need
to
generate
program
interfaces
internally
based
on
metadata
(descriptions),
and
to
represent
virtual

by
using
those
program

A
twin
has
to
produce
a
description
for
the
virtual

make
it
externally
available.
</p>
<p>
Identifiers
of
virtual
devices
need
to
be
newly
assigned,
therefore,
are
different
from
the
original
devices.
This
makes
sure
that
virtual

and
the
original

are
clearly
recognized
as
separate
entities.
Transport
and
security
mechanisms
and
settings
of
the
virtual

can
be
different
from
original
devices
if
necessary.
Virtual
devices
are
required
to
have
descriptions
provided
either
directly
by
the
twin
or
to
have
them
available
at
external
locations.
In
either
case
it

For
TDs

to

there
needs

by
providing

<p>
Descriptions
of

Accessibility

</div>
<p>
The
Web
of
Things
primarily
targets
machine-to-machine
communication.
The
humans
involved
are
usually
developers
that
integrate
Things
into
applications.
End-users
will
be
faced
with
the
front-ends
of
the
applications
or
the
physical
user
interfaces
provided
by
devices
themselves.
Both
are
out
of
scope
of
the
<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
WoT
specifications.
Given
the
focus
on
IoT
instead
of
users,
accessibility
is
not
a
direct
requirement,
and
hence
is
not
addressed
within
this
specification.
</p>
<p>
There
is,
however,
an
interesting
aspect
on
accessibility:
Fulfilling
the
requirements
above
enables
machines
to
understand
the
network-facing
API
of
devices.
This
can
be
utilized
by
accessibility
tools
to
provide
user
interfaces
of
different
modality,
thereby
removing
barriers
to
using
physical
devices
and
IoT-related
applications.
